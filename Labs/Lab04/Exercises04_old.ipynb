      "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a method for reducing the dimnesionality of documents treated as a bag of words. It is used for document classification, clustering and retrieval. For example, LSA can be used to search for prior art given a new patent application. In this homework, we will implement a small library for simple latent semantic analysis as a practical example of the application of SVD. The ideas are very similar to PCA."
