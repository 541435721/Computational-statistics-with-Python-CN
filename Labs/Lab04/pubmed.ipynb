Non-synonymous mutations in the kelch propeller domain (K13-propeller) in Plasmodium falciparum have been associated with artemisinin resistance in samples from southeast Asia, but additional studies are needed to characterize this locus in other P. falciparum populations with different levels of artemisinin use. Here, we sequenced the K13-propeller locus in 82 samples from Haiti, where limited government oversight of non-governmental organizations may have resulted in low-level use of artemisinin-based combination therapies. We detected a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 1,359 in a single isolate. Our results contribute to our understanding of the global genomic diversity of the K13-propeller locus in P. falciparum populations.',\n",
        " 'Genome-wide association study of clinically defined gout identifies multiple risk loci and its association with clinical subtypes.\\nOBJECTIVE: Gout, caused by hyperuricaemia, is a multifactorial disease. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of gout have been reported, they included self-reported gout cases in which clinical information was insufficient. Therefore, the relationship between genetic variation and clinical subtypes of gout remains unclear. Here, we first performed a GWAS of clinically defined gout cases only. METHODS: A GWAS was conducted with 945 patients with clinically defined gout and 1213 controls in a Japanese male population, followed by replication study of 1048 clinically defined cases and 1334 controls. RESULTS: Five gout susceptibility loci were identified at the genome-wide significance level (p<5.0x10-8), which contained well-known urate transporter genes (ABCG2 and SLC2A9) and additional genes: rs1260326 (p=1.9x10-12; OR=1.36) of GCKR (a gene for glucose and lipid metabolism), rs2188380 (p=1.6x10-23; OR=1.75) of MYL2-CUX2 (genes associated with cholesterol and diabetes mellitus) and rs4073582 (p=6.4x10-9; OR=1.66) of CNIH-2 (a gene for regulation of glutamate signalling). The latter two are identified as novel gout loci. Furthermore, among the identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we demonstrated that the SNPs of ABCG2 and SLC2A9 were differentially associated with types of gout and clinical parameters underlying specific subtypes (renal underexcretion type and renal overload type). The effect of the risk allele of each SNP on clinical parameters showed significant linear relationships with the ratio of the case-control ORs for two distinct types of gout (r=0.96 [p=4.8x10-4] for urate clearance and r=0.96 [p=5.0x10-4] for urinary urate excretion). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide clues to better understand the pathogenesis of gout and will be useful for development of companion diagnostics.',\n",
        " 'The Avian Transcriptome Response to Malaria Infection.\\nMalaria parasites are highly virulent pathogens which infect a wide range of vertebrates. Despite their importance, the way different hosts control and suppress malaria infections remains poorly understood. With recent developments in next generation sequencing techniques, however, it is now possible to quantify the response of the entire transcriptome to infections. We experimentally infected Eurasian siskins (Spinus spinus) with avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium ashfordi), and used high-throughput RNA-sequencing to measure the avian transcriptome in blood collected before infection (day 0), during peak parasitemia (day 21 post infection), and when parasitemia was decreasing (day 31). We found considerable differences in the transcriptomes of infected and uninfected individuals, with a large number of genes differentially expressed during both peak and decreasing parasitemia stages. These genes were overrepresented among functions involved in the immune system, stress response, cell death regulation, metabolism, and telomerase activity. Comparative analyses of the differentially expressed genes in our study to those found in other hosts of malaria (human and mouse), revealed a set of genes that are potentially involved in highly conserved evolutionary responses to malaria infection. By using RNA-sequencing we gained a more complete view of the host response, and were able to pinpoint not only well documented host genes, but also unannotated genes with clear significance during infection, such as microRNAs. This study shows how the avian blood transcriptome shifts in response to malaria infection, and we believe it will facilitate further research into the diversity of molecular mechanisms that hosts utilize to fight malaria infections.',\n",
        " 'Rapid drug tolerance and dramatic sterilizing effect of moxifloxacin monotherapy in a novel hollow fiber model of intracellular Mycobacterium kansasii disease.\\nMycobacterium kansasii is the second most common mycobacterial cause of lung disease. Standard treatment consists of rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol, for at least 12 months after negative sputum. Thus shorter duration therapies are needed. Moxifloxacin has good minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for M kansasii. However, good pre-clinical models for use to identify optimal doses are currently lacking. We developed a novel hollow fiber system model of intracellular M. kansasii infection. We indexed the efficacy of the standard combination regimen, which was a kill rate of -0.08+/-0.05 log10 CFU/mL/day (r2=0.99). Next, we performed moxifloxacin dose-effect and dose-scheduling studies at a half-life of 11.1+/-6.47 hours. Some systems were also treated with the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. The highest moxifloxacin exposure, as well as lower exposures plus reserpine, sterilized the cultures by day 7. This suggests that efflux pump-mediated tolerance at a low AUC0-24/MICs is an early bacterial defense mechanism, but is overcome by higher exposures. The highest rate of moxifloxacin monotherapy sterilization was -0.82+/-0.15 log10 CFU/mL/day (r2=0.97). The moxifloxacin exposure associated with 80% of maximal kill (EC80) was an AUC0-24/MIC of 317 (non-protein bound 158.5). We performed Monte Carlo simulations of 10,000 patients, in order to identify the moxifloxacin dose that would achieve or exceed the EC80. The simulations revealed an optimal moxifloxacin dose of 800 mg a day. The MIC susceptibility breakpoint at this dose was 0.25 mg/L. Thus moxifloxacin, at good enough doses, is suitable to study in patients for the potential to add rapid sterilization to the standard regimen.',\n",

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, including saxagliptin, are recommended as add-on therapy to metformin and as part of two- or three-drug combinations in patients not meeting individualized glycemic goals with metformin alone or as part of a dual-therapy regimen. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin as an add-on therapy to metformin, glyburide, a thiazolidinedione, or insulin (with or without metformin) and as a component of triple therapy with metformin and a sulfonylurea.',\n",
        " \"Baseline Cortisol Moderates Testosterone Reactivity to Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Competition.\\nRecent research suggests that cortisol (C) level moderates testosterone (T) reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in men. The extent to which C moderates T reactivity in other circumstances and in women is not known. In this retrospective study, before- and after-competition salivary levels of C and T from 97 intercollegiate women athletes competing in one of four different sports (soccer, volleyball, softball, tennis) were used to evaluate the influence of before-competition C level on T reactivity in women's athletic competition. Athletic competition was associated with a substantial increase in salivary levels of C and T in the vast majority of athletes. Before-competition level of C significantly moderated testosterone reactivity to athletic competition - women with relatively low levels of C showed larger increases in T to competition than women with higher levels of C. Clearly, the moderating effect of C on T reactivity is not limited to laboratory settings intended to increase social stress, but is also seen in (as we show here) the context of athletic competition.\",\n",

        " 'Effects of surface reflectance on local second order shape estimation in dynamic scenes.\\nIn dynamic scenes, relative motion between the object, the observer, and/or the environment projects as dynamic visual information onto the retina (optic flow) that facilitates 3D shape perception. When the object is diffusely reflective, e.g. a matte painted surface, this optic flow is directly linked to object shape, a property found at the foundations of most traditional Shape-from-Motion (SfM) schemes. When the object is specular, the corresponding specular flow is related to shape curvature, a regime change that challenges the visual system to determine concurrently both the shape and the distortions of the (sometimes unknown) environment reflected from its surface. While human observers are able to judge the global 3D shape of most specular objects, Shape-from-Specular-Flow (SFSF) is not veridical. In fact, recent studies have also shown systematic biases in the perceived motion of such objects. Here we focus on the perception of local shape from specular flow and compare it to that of matte-textured rotating objects. Observers judged local surface shape by adjusting a rotation and scale invariant shape index probe. Compared to shape judgments of static objects we find that object motion decreases intra-observer variability in local shape estimation. Moreover, object motion introduces systematic changes in perceived shape between matte-textured and specular conditions. Taken together, this study provides a new insight toward the contribution of motion and surface material to local shape perception.',\n",
        " 'Sex-specific differences in lipid and glucose metabolism.\\nEnergy metabolism in humans is tuned to distinct sex-specific functions that potentially reflect the unique requirements in females for gestation and lactation, whereas male metabolism may represent a default state. These differences are the consequence of the action of sex chromosomes and sex-specific hormones, including estrogens and progesterone in females and androgens in males. In humans, sex-specific specialization is associated with distinct body-fat distribution and energy substrate-utilization patterns; i.e., females store more lipids and have higher whole-body insulin sensitivity than males, while males tend to oxidize more lipids than females. These patterns are influenced by the menstrual phase in females, and by nutritional status and exercise intensity in both sexes. This minireview focuses on sex-specific mechanisms in lipid and glucose metabolism and their regulation by sex hormones, with a primary emphasis on studies in humans and the most relevant pre-clinical model of human physiology, non-human primates.',\n",
        " 'Transient Receptor Potential A1 Activation Prolongs Isoflurane Induction Latency and Impairs Respiratory Function in Mice.\\nBACKGROUND:: Isoflurane is a potent volatile anesthetic; however, it evokes airway irritation and neurogenic constriction through transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 channels and sensitizes TRPV1 channels, which colocalizes with TRPA1 in most of the vagal C-fibers innervating the airway. However, little is known about the precise effects of these two channels on the respiratory function during isoflurane anesthesia. METHODS:: By using a rodent behavioral model and whole-body plethysmograph, the authors examined the response of Trpa1 and Trpv1 mice to isoflurane anesthesia and monitored their respiratory functions during anesthesia. RESULTS:: This study showed that Trpa1 mice (n = 9), but not Trpv1 mice (n = 11), displayed a shortened induction latency compared with wild-type mice (n = 10) during isoflurane anesthesia (33 +/- 2.0 s in wild-type and 33 +/- 3.8 s in Trpv1 vs. 17 +/- 1.8 in Trpa1 at 2.2 minimum alveolar concentrations). By contrast, their response to the nonpungent volatile anesthetic sevoflurane is indistinguishable from wild-type mice (24 +/- 3.6 s in wild-type vs. 26 +/- 1.0 s in Trpa1 at 2.4 minimum alveolar concentrations). The authors discovered that Trpa1 mice inhaled more anesthetic but maintained better respiratory function. Further respiration pattern analysis revealed that isoflurane triggered nociceptive reflexes and led to prolonged resting time between breaths during isoflurane induction as well as decreased dynamic pulmonary compliance, an indicator of airway constriction, throughout isoflurane anesthesia in wild-type and Trpv1 mice, but not in Trpa1 mice. CONCLUSION:: Activation of TRPA1 by isoflurane negatively affects anesthetic induction latency by altering respiratory patterns and impairing pulmonary compliance.',\n",
        " 'Distinct Helix Propensities and Membrane Interactions of Human and Rat IAPP Monomers in Anionic Lipid Bilayers.\\nIslet amyloid polypeptide, IAPP or amylin, is a 37-residue peptide hormone coexpressed with insulin by pancreatic beta-cells. The aggregation of human IAPP (hIAPP) into amyloid deposits is associated with type II diabetes. Substantial evidence suggests that the interaction of anionic membranes with hIAPP may facilitate peptide aggregation and the N-terminal 1~19 fragment (IAPP1-19) plays an important role in peptide-membrane interaction. As a first step to understand how structural differences between human and rat IAPP peptides in membrane may influence the later oligomerization process, we have investigated the structures and orientations of hIAPP1-19 and the less toxic rIAPP1-19 (i.e. the H18R mutant of hIAPP1-19) monomers in anionic POPG bilayers by performing replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. On the basis of ~20-mus REMD simulations started from a random coil conformation of the peptide placed in water, we find that unfolded h(r)IAPP1-19 can insert into the bilayers and the membrane-bound peptide stays mainly at the lipid head-tail interface. hIAPP1-19 displays higher propensity to adopt helical conformations than rIAPP1-19, especially in the L12~L16 region. The helical conformation is oriented parallel to the bilayer surface and buried in the membrane 0.3~0.8 nm below the phosphorus atoms, consistent with previous electron paramagnetic resonance data. The helical conformation is an amphiphilic helix with its hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces pointing respectively to the lipid head and tail regions. The H18R substitution enhances the electrostatic interactions of IAPP1-19 with membrane, while weakens the intra-peptide interactions crucial for helix formation, thus leading to lower helix propensity of rIAPP1-19. Implications of our simulation results on the membrane-mediated IAPP1-19 oligomerization are discussed.',\n",
        " 'Aspergillus flavus induces granulomatous cerebral aspergillosis in mice with display of distinct cytokine profile.\\nAspergillus flavus is one of the leading Aspergillus spp. resulting in invasive aspergillosis of central nervous system (CNS) in human beings. Immunological status in aspergillosis of central nervous system remains elusive in case of both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Since cytokines are the major mediators of host response, evaluation of disease pathology along with cytokine profile in brain may provide snapshots of neuro-immunological response. An intravenous model of A. flavus infection was utilized to determine the pathogenicity of infection and cytokine profile in the brain of male BALB/c mice. Enumeration of colony forming units and histopathological analyses were performed on the brain tissue at distinct time periods. The kinetics of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-6, IL-23, IL-17A and IL-4) was evaluated at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96h post infection (hPI) in brain homogenates using murine cytokine specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Histological analysis exhibited the hyphae with leukocyte infiltrations leading to formation of granulomata along with ischemia and pyknosis of neurons in the brain of infected mice. Diseased mice displayed increased secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-12p40 and IL-6 with a concomitant reduction in the secretion of Th2 cytokine IL-4, and Th17 promoting cytokine, IL-23 during the late phase of infection. A.flavus induced inflammatory granulomatous cerebral aspergillosis in mice, characterized by a marked increase in the Th1 cytokines and neurons undergoing necrosis. A marked increase in necrosis of neurons with concurrent inflammatory responses might have led to the host mortality during late phase of infection.',\n",
        " 'The pathophysiology of extracellular hemoglobin associated with enhanced oxidative reactions.\\nHemoglobin (Hb) continuously undergoes autoxidation producing superoxide which dismutates into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and is a potential source for subsequent oxidative reactions. Autoxidation is most pronounced under hypoxic conditions in the microcirculation and for unstable dimers formed at reduced Hb concentrations. In the red blood cell (RBC), oxidative reactions are inhibited by an extensive antioxidant system. For extracellular Hb, whether from hemolysis of RBCs and/or the infusion of Hb-based blood substitutes, the oxidative reactions are not completely neutralized by the available antioxidant system. Un-neutralized H2O2 oxidizes ferrous and ferric Hbs to Fe(IV)-ferrylHb and OxyferrylHb, respectively. FerrylHb further reacts with H2O2 producing heme degradation products and free iron. OxyferrylHb, in addition to Fe(IV) contains a free radical that can undergo additional oxidative reactions. Fe(III)Hb produced during Hb autoxidation also readily releases heme, an additional source for oxidative stress. These oxidation products are a potential source for oxidative reactions in the plasma, but to a greater extent when the lower molecular weight Hb dimers are taken up into cells and tissues. Heme and oxyferryl have been shown to have a proinflammatory effect further increasing their potential for oxidative stress. These oxidative reactions contribute to a number of pathological situations including atherosclerosis, kidney malfunction, sickle cell disease, and malaria. The toxic effects of extracellular Hb are of particular concern with hemolytic anemia where there is an increase in hemolysis. Hemolysis is further exacerbated in various diseases and their treatments. Blood transfusions are required whenever there is an appreciable decrease in RBCs due to hemolysis or blood loss. It is, therefore, essential that the transfused blood, whether stored RBCs or the blood obtained by an Autologous Blood Recovery System from the patient, do not further increase extracellular Hb.',\n",

Although Gram-positive bacteria contain structurally distinct PGNs that are considered to differently interact with the GIT, PGN-binding proteins (PGN-BPs) in the GIT have been poorly understood. In the present study, we purified PGNs from Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus (named as Lp.PGN and Sa.PGN, respectively) and identified Lp.PGN-BPs and Sa.PGN-BPs in the lysate of mouse GIT. Lp.PGN activated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and NOD2, whereas Sa.PGN activated NOD2, but not NOD1, implying that both PGNs retained the biological activity and were differently recognized by the host cells. PGN-BPs were isolated by precipitation with Lp.PGN or Sa.PGN and identified using LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid Fourier transform mass spectrometry. Three independent experiments demonstrated that 18 Lp.PGN-BPs and 6 Sa.PGN-BPs were reproducibly obtained with statistical significance (P<0.05). Both Lp.PGN and Sa.PGN bound to proteins which are related to cytoskeleton, microbial adhesion, and mucosal integrity. Lp.PGN selectively bound to proteins related to gene expression, chaperone, and antimicrobial function. However, Sa.PGN preferentially interacted with proteins involved in adherence and invasion of pathogens. Collectively, these results suggest that bacterial PGNs interact with the proteins regulating mucosal homeostasis and immunity in the gut and PGNs of commensals and pathogens might be also differentially recognized in the GIT.',\n",

Although molecular determinants of ALI have been reported, the molecules involved in disease catabasis associated with oxygen toxicity have not been well studied. It has been reported that lung mucosa is rich in omega-3 fatty acid dicosahexanoic acid (DHA), which has anti-inflammatory properties. Aspirin triggered-resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) is a potent proresolution metabolite of DHA which can curb the inflammatory effects in various acute injuries, yet the effect of AT-RvD1 on hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI) or in the oxygen toxicity setting in general has not been investigated. The effects of AT-RvD1 in HALI were determined for the first time in 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice which were exposed to hyperoxia (>/=95% O2) for 48hrs. Mice were either given AT-RvD1 (100ng) in saline or a saline vehicle for 24hrs in normoxic ( approximately 21% O2) conditions following hyperoxia. Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected for analysis associated with proinflammatory signaling and lung inflammation. AT-RvD1 treatment resulted in reduced oxidative stress, increased glutathione production and significantly decreased tissue inflammation. AT-RvD1 treatment also significantly reduced the lung wet/dry ratio, protein in BAL fluid, and decreased apoptotic and NFkappaB signaling. These results show that AT-RvD1 curbs oxygen induced lung edema, permeability, inflammation, and apoptosis and is thus an effective therapy for prolonged hyperoxic exposure in this murine model.',\n",

For cognition and behaviour, identification of underlying genes provides new entry points for deciphering the key neurobiological pathways. In the past decade, the search for genetic correlates of musicality has gained traction. Reports have documented familial clustering for different extremes of ability, including amusia and absolute pitch (AP), with twin studies demonstrating high heritability for some music-related skills, such as pitch perception. Certain chromosomal regions have been linked to AP and musical aptitude, while individual candidate genes have been investigated in relation to aptitude and creativity. Most recently, researchers in this field started performing genome-wide association scans. Thus far, studies have been hampered by relatively small sample sizes and limitations in defining components of musicality, including an emphasis on skills that can only be assessed in trained musicians. With opportunities to administer standardized aptitude tests online, systematic large-scale assessment of musical abilities is now feasible, an important step towards high-powered genome-wide screens. Here, we offer a synthesis of existing literatures and outline concrete suggestions for the development of comprehensive operational tools for the analysis of musical phenotypes.',\n",

Therefore, it is important to investigate whether smokers who have weight concerns respond to tobacco control policies differently than smokers who do not in terms of quit attempts, and how this difference varies by gender and country. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate, by gender and country, whether smokers who believe that smoking helps control weight are less responsive to tobacco control policies with regards to quit attempts than those who do not. METHODS: We use longitudinal data from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project in the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia to conduct the analysis. We first constructed a dichotomous indicator for smokers who have the weight control belief and then examined the disparity in policy responsiveness in terms of quit attempts by directly estimating the interaction terms of policies and the weight control belief indicator using generalised estimating equations. FINDINGS: We find that weight control belief significantly attenuates the policy impact of tobacco control measures on quit attempts among US female smokers and among UK smokers. This pattern was not found among smokers in Canada and Australia. CONCLUSIONS: Although our results vary by gender and country, the findings suggest that weight concerns do alter policy responsiveness in quit attempts in certain populations. Policy makers should take this into account and alleviate weight concerns to enhance the effectiveness of existing tobacco control policies on promoting quitting smoking.',\n",

Advances in multiparametric flow-cytometry have revealed that the functional quality of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells, determines immune protection in many infectious models. Little is known about the functional characteristics of Plasmodium-specific CD4 responses in immune and non-immune individuals. METHODS: We compared T cell responses to P. falciparum among household-matched children and adults residing in high and low malaria transmission settings in Uganda. PBMCs were stimulated with P. falciparum antigen and IFNgamma, IL2, IL10 and TNFalpha production was analyzed via multiparametric flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that the magnitude of CD4 responses was greater in areas of high transmission, but was similar between children and adults at each site. In high transmission settings, most P. falciparum-specific CD4 T cells in children produced IL10, while responses in adults were dominated by IFNgamma and TNFalpha. In contrast, in low transmission settings, responses in both children and adults were dominated by IFNgamma and TNFalpha. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight major differences in the CD4 response of immune adults and non-immune children that may be relevant for immune protection from malaria.',\n",
        " \"Self-affirmation alters the brain's response to health messages and subsequent behavior change.\\nHealth communications can be an effective way to increase positive health behaviors and decrease negative health behaviors; however, those at highest risk are often most defensive and least open to such messages. For example, increasing physical activity among sedentary individuals affects a wide range of important mental and physical health outcomes, but has proven a challenging task. Affirming core values (i.e., self-affirmation) before message exposure is a psychological technique that can increase the effectiveness of a wide range of interventions in health and other domains; however, the neural mechanisms of affirmation's effects have not been studied. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural processes associated with affirmation effects during exposure to potentially threatening health messages. We focused on an a priori defined region of interest (ROI) in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region selected for its association with self-related processing and positive valuation. Consistent with our hypotheses, those in the self-affirmation condition produced more activity in VMPFC during exposure to health messages and went on to increase their objectively measured activity levels more. These findings suggest that affirmation of core values may exert its effects by allowing at-risk individuals to see the self-relevance and value in otherwise-threatening messages.\",\n",

Although rapid immunochromatographic tests (RDTs) have been deployed to diagnose diseases such as malaria, the extreme climate conditions encountered in these regions compounded with the discrepancies in test manufacturing have yielded varying results, so that more innovative and robust technologies are sought. Devoid of antibodies and thermally sensitive materials, we present a robust, colorimetric diagnostic platform for the detection of a malarial biomarker, Plasmodium falciparum Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (PfHRP-II). The assay exploits the optical properties of gold nanoparticles, covalently coupling them to a Ni(II)NTA recognition element specific for PfHRP-II. In the presence of the recombinant malarial biomarker (rcHRP-II), the Ni(II)NTA AuNPs begin to crosslink and aggregate in as little as one minute, triggering a red-to-purple color change in solution. To increase assay sensitivity and platform stability suitable for low-resource regions, the Ni(II)NTA AuNPs were assembled with varying spacer ligands in a mixed monolayer presentation. When assembled with a negatively charged Peg4-thiol ligand, the Ni(II)NTA AuNPs demonstrate low nanomolar limits of rcHRP-II detection in physiological concentrations of human serum albumin and maintain excellent stability at 37 degrees C when stored for four weeks. Detection of the malaria biomarker is also measured by capturing and processing images of aggregated gold nanoparticles with a smartphone camera. By utilizing a smartphone camera and image processing application, there is no significant difference in assay sensitivity and rcHRP-II limit of detection in comparison to a spectrophotometer, further making this diagnostic platform applicable for use in low-resource regions.',\n",
        " 'Heterogeneous CD3 Expression Levels in Differing T Cell Subsets Correlate with the In Vivo Anti-CD3-Mediated T Cell Modulation.\\nThe tolerogenic anti-CD3epsilon monoclonal Abs (anti-CD3) are promising compounds for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Anti-CD3 administration induces transient T cell depletion both in preclinical and in clinical studies. Notably, the said depletion mainly affects CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells. Moreover, type 1 diabetes reversal in preclinical models is accompanied by the selective expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells, which are fundamental for the long-term maintenance of anti-CD3-mediated tolerance. The mechanisms that lead to this immune-shaping by affecting mainly CD4+ T effector cells while sparing CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells have still to be fully elucidated. This study shows that CD3 expression levels differ from one T cell subset to another. CD4+Foxp3- T cells contain higher amounts of CD3 molecules than do CD4+Foxp3+ and CD8+ T cells in both mice and humans. The said differences correlate with the anti-CD3-mediated immune resetting that occurs in vivo after anti-CD3 administration in diabetic NOD mice. Additionally, transcriptome analysis demonstrates that CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells are significantly less responsive than are CD4+Foxp3- T cells to anti-CD3 treatment at a molecular level. Thus, heterogeneity in CD3 expression seems to confer to the various T cell subsets differing susceptibility to the in vivo tolerogenic anti-CD3-mediated modulation. These data shed new light on the molecular mechanism that underlies anti-CD3-mediated immune resetting and thus may open new opportunities to improve this promising treatment.',\n",

In the endeavor to fill this gap in the literature, the current study searches for associations between participants' social perception abilities as measured by the interpersonal perception task (IPT) and the rs2268498 polymorphism on the OXTR-gene, which has repeatedly been linked to processes relevant to social functioning. N = 105 healthy participants were experimentally tested with the IPT and genotyped for the rs2268498 polymorphism. T-allele carriers (TT and TC genotypes) exhibited significantly better performance in the IPT than carriers of the CC-genotype. This difference was also significant for the subscales measuring the strength of social bonding (kinship and intimacy). As in previous studies, T-allele carriers exhibited better performance in measures of social processing indicating that the rs2268498 polymorphism is an important candidate for understanding the genetic basis of social functioning.\",\n",
        " 'Modulation of Cytochrome P450 2A5 Activity by Lipopolysaccharide: Low-Dose Effects and Non-Monotonic Dose-Response Relationship.\\nMouse cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A5 is induced by inflammatory conditions and infectious diseases that down-regulate the expression and activity of most other CYP isoforms. Enhanced oxidative stress and nuclear factor (erythroid 2-related factor) 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor activation have been hypothesised to mediate up-regulation of CYP2A5 expression in the murine liver. The unique and complex regulation of CYP2A5, however, is far from being thoroughly elucidated. Sepsis and high doses of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elicit oxidative stress in the liver, but depression, not induction, of CYP2A5 has been observed in studies of mice treated with LPS. The foregoing facts prompted us to evaluate the response of CYP2A5 liver activity in female DBA-2 mice over a broad range of LPS doses (0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg). Cytokine levels (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, interferon gamma, tumour necrosis factor alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in the blood serum. Activities of CYP1A (EROD) and CYP2B (BROD) in the liver were also determined for comparative purposes. LPS depressed CYP2A5 at low doses (0.025-2.0 mg/kg) but not at doses (>2 mg/kg) that increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO serum levels, and depressed CYP1A and CYP2B activities. Blockade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the overproduction of NO induced by co-treatment with pentoxifylline and LPS and iNOS inhibition with aminoguanidine both extended down-regulation of CYP2A5 to the high dose range while not affecting LPS-induced depression of CYP1A and CYP2B. Overall, the results suggested that NO plays a role in the reversal of the low-dose LPS-induced depression of CYP2A5 observed when mice were challenged with higher doses of LPS.',\n",
        " 'Immunological loss-of-function due to genetic gain-of-function in humans: autosomal dominance of the third kind.\\nAll the human primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) recognized as such in the 1950s were Mendelian traits and, whether autosomal or X-linked, displayed recessive inheritance. The first autosomal dominant (AD) PID, hereditary angioedema, was recognized in 1963. However, since the first identification of autosomal recessive (AR), X-linked recessive (XR) and AD PID-causing genes in 1985 (ADA; severe combined immunodeficiency), 1986 (CYBB, chronic granulomatous disease) and 1989 (SERPING1; hereditary angioedema), respectively, the number of genetically defined AD PIDs has increased more rapidly than that of any other type of PID. AD PIDs now account for 61 of the 260 known conditions (23%). All known AR PIDs are caused by alleles with some loss-of-function (LOF). A single XR PID is caused by gain-of-function (GOF) mutations (WASP-related neutropenia, 2001). In contrast, only 44 of 61 AD defects are caused by LOF alleles, which exert dominance by haploinsufficiency or negative dominance. Since 2003, up to 17 AD disorders of the third kind, due to GOF alleles, have been described. Remarkably, six of the 17 genes concerned also harbor monoallelic (STAT3), biallelic (C3, CFB, CARD11, PIK3R1) or both monoallelic and biallelic (STAT1) LOF alleles in patients with other clinical phenotypes. Most heterozygous GOF alleles result in auto-inflammation, auto-immunity, or both, with a wide range of immunological and clinical forms. Some also underlie infections and, fewer, allergies, by impairing or enhancing immunity to non-self. Malignancies are also rare. The enormous diversity of immunological and clinical phenotypes is thought provoking and mirrors the diversity and pleiotropy of the underlying genotypes. These experiments of nature provide a unique insight into the quantitative regulation of human immunity.',\n",

DESIGN:: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING:: Tertiary pediatric critical care unit at Ronald McDonald Children's Hospital at Loyola University Medical Center. PATIENTS:: We enrolled 59 patients (4 weeks to 18 years of age) between January 2012 and May 2013. Thirty-four patients were included in the salivary to serum free cortisol correlational analysis. INTERVENTIONS:: Blood and saliva samples were obtained simultaneously within 24 hours of admission between the hours of 6 AM and 12 PM. Salivary cortisol was tested by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, serum free cortisol by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry followed by equilibrium dialysis, and serum total cortisol by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Salivary and serum free cortisol values from 34 patients had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-0.93; p < 0.0001). The total serum and salivary cortisol values had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42-0.81; p < 0.0001). The total serum and serum free cortisol values had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69-0.91; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:: Serum free and salivary cortisol values correlate in critically ill children. Salivary cortisol can be used as a surrogate for serum free cortisol in critically ill pediatric patients. Salivary cortisol is a cost-effective and less invasive measure of bioavailable cortisol and offers an alternate and accurate method for assessing critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency in children.\",\n",
        " 'IFN Regulatory Factor 8 Represses GM-CSF Expression in T Cells To Affect Myeloid Cell Lineage Differentiation.\\nDuring hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells constantly differentiate into granulocytes and macrophages via a distinct differentiation program that is tightly controlled by myeloid lineage-specific transcription factors. Mice with a null mutation of IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) accumulate CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells that phenotypically and functionally resemble tumor-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), indicating an essential role of IRF8 in myeloid cell lineage differentiation. However, IRF8 is expressed in various types of immune cells, and whether IRF8 functions intrinsically or extrinsically in regulation of myeloid cell lineage differentiation is not fully understood. In this study, we report an intriguing finding that, although IRF8-deficient mice exhibit deregulated myeloid cell differentiation and resultant accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs, surprisingly, mice with IRF8 deficiency only in myeloid cells exhibit no abnormal myeloid cell lineage differentiation. Instead, mice with IRF8 deficiency only in T cells exhibited deregulated myeloid cell differentiation and MDSC accumulation. We further demonstrated that IRF8-deficient T cells exhibit elevated GM-CSF expression and secretion. Treatment of mice with GM-CSF increased MDSC accumulation, and adoptive transfer of IRF8-deficient T cells, but not GM-CSF-deficient T cells, increased MDSC accumulation in the recipient chimeric mice. Moreover, overexpression of IRF8 decreased GM-CSF expression in T cells. Our data determine that, in addition to its intrinsic function as an apoptosis regulator in myeloid cells, IRF8 also acts extrinsically to repress GM-CSF expression in T cells to control myeloid cell lineage differentiation, revealing a novel mechanism that the adaptive immune component of the immune system regulates the innate immune cell myelopoiesis in vivo.',\n",

        " \"Erythritol predicted to inhibit permeation of water and solutes through the conducting pore of P. falciparum aquaporin.\\nPlasmodium falciparum aquaporin (PfAQP) is a multifunctional channel protein in the plasma membrane of the malarial parasite that causes the most severe form of malaria infecting more than a million people a year. This channel protein facilitates transport of water and several solutes across the cell membrane. In order to better elucidate the fundamental interactions between PfAQP and its permeants and among the permeants, I conducted over three microseconds in silico experiments of atomistic models of the PfAQP-membrane system to obtain the free-energy profiles of five permeants (erythritol, water, glycerol, urea, and ammonia) throughout the amphipathic conducting pore of PfAQP. The profiles are analyzed in light of and shown to be consistent with the existent in vitro data. The binding affinities are computed using the free-energy profiles and the permeant fluctuations inside the channel. On this basis, it is predicted that erythritol, a permeant of PfAQP itself having a deep ditch in its permeation passageway, inhibits PfAQP's functions of transporting water and other solutes with an IC50 in the range of high nanomolars. This leads to the possibility that erythritol, a sweetener generally considered safe, may inhibit or kill the malarial parasite in vivo without causing undesired side effects. Experimental studies are hereby called for to directly test this theoretical prediction of erythritol strongly inhibiting PfAQP in vitro and possibly inhibiting P. falciparum in vivo.\",\n",
        " \"Resveratrol Prevents Oxidative Stress-Induced Senescence and Proliferative Dysfunction by Activating the AMPK-FOXO3 Cascade in Cultured Primary Human Keratinocytes.\\nThe aging process is perceived as resulting from a combination of intrinsic factors such as changes in intracellular signaling and extrinsic factors, most notably environmental stressors. In skin, the relationship between intrinsic changes and keratinocyte function is not clearly understood. Previously, we found that increasing the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppressed senescence in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-treated human primary keratinocytes, a model of oxidative stress-induced cellular aging. Using this model in the present study, we observed that resveratrol, an agent that increases the activities of both AMPK and sirtuins, ameliorated two age-associated phenotypes: cellular senescence and proliferative dysfunction. In addition, we found that treatment of keratinocytes with Ex527, a specific inhibitor of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), attenuated the ability of resveratrol to suppress senescence. In keeping with the latter observation, we noted that compared to non-senescent keratinocytes, senescent cells lacked SIRT1. In addition to these effects on H2O2-induced senescence, resveratrol also prevented the H2O2-induced decrease in proliferation (as indicated by 3H-thymidine incorporation) in the presence of insulin. This effect was abrogated by inhibition of AMPK but not SIRT1. Compared to endothelium, we found that human keratinocytes expressed relatively high levels of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), a downstream target of both AMPK and SIRT1. Treatment of keratinocytes with resveratrol transactivated FOXO3 and increased the expression of its target genes including catalase. Resveratrol's effects on both senescence and proliferation disappeared when FOXO3 was knocked down. Finally, we performed an exploratory study which showed that skin from humans over 50 years old had lower AMPK activity than skin from individuals under age 20. Collectively, these findings suggest that the effects of resveratrol on keratinocyte senescence and proliferation are regulated by the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway and in some situations, but not all, by SIRT1.\",\n",
        " \"Valenced Cues and Contexts Have Different Effects on Event-Based Prospective Memory.\\nThis study examined the separate influence and joint influences on event-based prospective memory task performance due to the valence of cues and the valence of contexts. We manipulated the valence of cues and contexts with pictures from the International Affective Picture System. The participants, undergraduate students, showed higher performance when neutral compared to valenced pictures were used for cueing prospective memory. In addition, neutral pictures were more effective as cues when they occurred in a valenced context than in the context of neutral pictures, but the effectiveness of valenced cues did not vary across contexts that differed in valence. The finding of an interaction between cue and context valence indicates that their respective influence on event-based prospective memory task performance cannot be understood in isolation from each other. Our findings are not consistent with by the prevailing view which holds that the scope of attention is broadened and narrowed, respectively, by positively and negatively valenced stimuli. Instead, our findings are more supportive of the recent proposal that the scope of attention is determined by the motivational intensity associated with valenced stimuli. Consistent with this proposal, we speculate that the motivational intensity associated with different retrieval cues determines the scope of attention, that contexts with different valence values determine participants' task engagement, and that prospective memory task performance is determined jointly by attention scope and task engagement.\",\n",
        " 'Cross-cultural perspectives on music and musicality.\\nMusical behaviours are universal across human populations and, at the same time, highly diverse in their structures, roles and cultural interpretations. Although laboratory studies of isolated listeners and music-makers have yielded important insights into sensorimotor and cognitive skills and their neural underpinnings, they have revealed little about the broader significance of music for individuals, peer groups and communities. This review presents a sampling of musical forms and coordinated musical activity across cultures, with the aim of highlighting key similarities and differences. The focus is on scholarly and everyday ideas about music-what it is and where it originates-as well the antiquity of music and the contribution of musical behaviour to ritual activity, social organization, caregiving and group cohesion. Synchronous arousal, action synchrony and imitative behaviours are among the means by which music facilitates social bonding. The commonalities and differences in musical forms and functions across cultures suggest new directions for ethnomusicology, music cognition and neuroscience, and a pivot away from the predominant scientific focus on instrumental music in the Western European tradition.',\n",

An FMRI investigation in sub-clinical depression and controls.\\nThe capacity to learn new information and manipulate it for efficient retrieval has long been studied through reasoning paradigms, which also has applicability to the study of social behavior. Humans can learn about the linear order within groups using reasoning, and the success of such reasoning may vary according to affective state, such as depression. We investigated the neural basis of these latter findings using functional neuroimaging. Using BDI-II criteria, 14 non-depressed (ND) and 12 mildly depressed volunteers took part in a linear-order reasoning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The hippocampus, parietal, and prefrontal cortices were activated during the task, in accordance with previous studies. In the learning phase and in the test phase, greater activation of the parietal cortex was found in the depressed group, which may be a compensatory mechanism in order to reach the same behavioral performance as the ND group, or evidence for a different reasoning strategy in the depressed group.',\n",
        " 'Antibodies to the Plasmodium falciparum proteins MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 opsonise merozoites, inhibit parasite growth and predict protection from clinical malaria.\\nIncreasing evidence suggests that antibodies against merozoite surface proteins play an important role in clinical immunity to malaria. Two unusual members of the Merozoite surface protein (MSP)-3 family named MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 have been shown to be extrinsically associated to MSP-1 on the parasite surface. In addition to a Secreted Polymorphic Antigen associated with Merozoite (SPAM) domain characteristic of MSP-3 family members, they also contain Duffy Binding Like (DBL) domain and were found to bind to erythrocytes suggesting that they play a role in parasite invasion. Antibody responses to these proteins were investigated in a treatment-re-infection study conducted in an endemic area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) to determine their contribution to naturally acquired immunity. Antibodies to the SPAM domains of MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 as well as the DBL domain of MSPDBL1 were found to be associated with protection from P. falciparum clinical episodes. Moreover, affinity purified anti-MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 were found to inhibit in vitro parasite growth and had strong merozoite opsonising capacity, suggesting that protection targeting these antigens results from at least 2 different effector mechanisms. Together these results indicate that MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 are important targets of naturally acquired immunity and might constitute potential vaccine candidates.',\n",
        " 'Comprehensive Sieve Analysis of Breakthrough HIV-1 Sequences in the RV144 Vaccine Efficacy Trial.\\nThe RV144 clinical trial showed the partial efficacy of a vaccine regimen with an estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) of 31% for protecting low-risk Thai volunteers against acquisition of HIV-1. The impact of vaccine-induced immune responses can be investigated through sieve analysis of HIV-1 breakthrough infections (infected vaccine and placebo recipients). A V1/V2-targeted comparison of the genomes of HIV-1 breakthrough viruses identified two V2 amino acid sites that differed between the vaccine and placebo groups. Here we extended the V1/V2 analysis to the entire HIV-1 genome using an array of methods based on individual sites, k-mers and genes/proteins. We identified 56 amino acid sites or \"signatures\" and 119 k-mers that differed between the vaccine and placebo groups. Of those, 19 sites and 38 k-mers were located in the regions comprising the RV144 vaccine (Env-gp120, Gag, and Pro). The nine signature sites in Env-gp120 were significantly enriched for known antibody-associated sites (p = 0.0021). In particular, site 317 in the third variable loop (V3) overlapped with a hotspot of antibody recognition, and sites 369 and 424 were linked to CD4 binding site neutralization. The identified signature sites significantly covaried with other sites across the genome (mean = 32.1) more than did non-signature sites (mean = 0.9) (p < 0.0001), suggesting functional and/or structural relevance of the signature sites. Since signature sites were not preferentially restricted to the vaccine immunogens and because most of the associations were insignificant following correction for multiple testing, we predict that few of the genetic differences are strongly linked to the RV144 vaccine-induced immune pressure. In addition to presenting results of the first complete-genome analysis of the breakthrough infections in the RV144 trial, this work describes a set of statistical methods and tools applicable to analysis of breakthrough infection genomes in general vaccine efficacy trials for diverse pathogens.',\n",
        " 'Lateralized differences in tympanic membrane temperature, but not induced mood, are related to episodic memory.\\nThe present research examined the effects of pre-encoding and pre-recall induced mood on episodic memory. It was hypothesized that happy and/or angry mood prior to encoding (increasing left hemisphere activity), in tandem with fearful mood prior to recall (increasing right hemisphere activity) would be associated with superior episodic memory. It was also hypothesized that tympanic membrane measures (TMT), indicative of hemispheric activity, would change as a function of induced mood. Although subjectively-experienced mood induction was successful, pre-encoding and pre-recall mood did not alter memory, and only altered TMT in the pre-encoding fear and pre-recall angry mood induction conditions. Interestingly, baseline absolute difference between left and right TMT, a measure of differential hemispheric activity, regardless of the direction of that activity, was significantly positively related to number of total words written, number of correctly recalled words, and corrected recall score. This same TMT measure pre-encoding, regardless of specific mood, was significantly negatively related to false recall. Results are discussed in terms the HERA model of episodic memory, and in the nature of interhemispheric interaction involved in episodic recall.',\n",

In contrast, we report here that STING potently suppresses inflammation in a model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lymphoid hypertrophy, autoantibody production, serum cytokine levels, and other indicators of immune activation were markedly increased in STING-deficient autoimmune-prone mice compared with STING-sufficient littermates. As a result, STING-deficient autoimmune-prone mice had significantly shorter lifespans than controls. Importantly, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent systemic inflammation during 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD)-mediated peritonitis was similarly aggravated in STING-deficient mice. Mechanistically, STING-deficient macrophages failed to express negative regulators of immune activation and thus were hyperresponsive to TLR ligands, producing abnormally high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This hyperreactivity corresponds to dramatically elevated numbers of inflammatory macrophages and granulocytes in vivo. Collectively these findings reveal an unexpected negative regulatory role for STING, having important implications for STING-directed therapies.',\n",

Antileishmanial drugs currently available have various limitations, mainly because of the parasite resistance and side effects. The search of new antileishmanial drugs is ventured throughout the world. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the leishmanicidal activity of lipophilic extracts of eight Hypericum species against promastigote forms of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The dried and powered materials of aerial parts of H. andinum Gleason, H. brevistylum Choisy, H. caprifoliatum Cham. & Schltdl., H. carinatum Griseb., H. linoides A. St.-Hil., H. myrianthum Cham. & Schltdl., H. polyanthemum Klotzsch ex Reichardt and H. silenoides Juss. were extracted by static maceration with n-hexane. Extracts were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and stored at -20 degrees C until biological evaluation and HPLC analysis. The metabolites investigated were dimeric phloroglucinol derivatives, benzophenones and benzopyrans. The yields were expressed as mean of three injections in mg of compound per g of extract (mg/g extract). The effect of Hypericum species on the viability of infective forms of L. (L.) amazonensis was determined using a hemocytometer. Amphotericin B was used as a standard drug. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for each extract were determined by linear regression analysis. The cytotoxic effects of extracts were assessed on peritoneal macrophages of BALB/c mice by MTT assay. The concentration that causes 50% of macrophage cytotoxicity (CC50) was determined by linear regression analysis. The selectivity index (SI) of the extracts was determined considering the following equation: CC50 against mammalian cells/IC50 against L. amazonensis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that H. carinatum, H. linoides and H. polyanthemum were able to kill the parasites in a dose dependent manner. These extracts presented low cytotoxicity against murine macrophages. At 48h of incubation H. polyanthemum presented significant leishmanicidal activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 36.1microg/ml. The leishmanicidal activity of H. myrianthum was significantly lower than that presented by H. polyanthemum, H. carinatum and H. linoides extracts. H. brevistylum and H. caprifoliatum showed significant leishmanicidal activity only at high concentrations (500 and 1000microg/ml), while H. andinum and H. silenoides were ineffective. CONCLUSION: The promising results demonstrate the importance of the species of the genus Hypericum as source of compounds potentially useful for the treatment of leishmaniasis.',\n",

Mesenchymal stem cells contribute to blood- and lymph- neoangiogenesis, generate myofibroblasts, with pro-invasive activity and may suppress anti-tumour immunity.Methods:In this paper, we evaluated the presence and features of MSCs isolated from human head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Results:Fresh specimens of HNSCC showed higher proportions of CD90+ cells compared with normal tissue; these cells co-expressed CD29, CD105, and CD73, but not CD31, CD45, CD133, and human epithelial antigen similarly to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). Adherent stromal cells isolated from tumour shared also differentiation potential with BM-MSCs, thus we named them as tumour-MSCs. Interestingly, tumour-MSCs showed a clear immunosuppressive activity on in vitro stimulated T lymphocytes, mainly mediated by indoelamine 2,3 dioxygenase activity, like BM-MSCs. To evaluate their possible role in tumour growth in vivo, we correlated tumour-MSC proportions with neoplasm size. Tumour-MSCs frequency directly correlated with tumour volume and inversely with the frequency of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes.Conclusions:These data support the concept that tumour-MSCs may favour tumour growth not only through their effect on stromal development, but also by inhibiting the anti-tumour immune response.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 3 February 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.15 www.bjcancer.com.',\n",
        " 'The origins of music in auditory scene analysis and the roles of evolution and culture in musical creation.\\nWhether music was an evolutionary adaptation that conferred survival advantages or a cultural creation has generated much debate. Consistent with an evolutionary hypothesis, music is unique to humans, emerges early in development and is universal across societies. However, the adaptive benefit of music is far from obvious. Music is highly flexible, generative and changes rapidly over time, consistent with a cultural creation hypothesis. In this paper, it is proposed that much of musical pitch and timing structure adapted to preexisting features of auditory processing that evolved for auditory scene analysis (ASA). Thus, music may have emerged initially as a cultural creation made possible by preexisting adaptations for ASA. However, some aspects of music, such as its emotional and social power, may have subsequently proved beneficial for survival and led to adaptations that enhanced musical behaviour. Ontogenetic and phylogenetic evidence is considered in this regard. In particular, enhanced auditory-motor pathways in humans that enable movement entrainment to music and consequent increases in social cohesion, and pathways enabling music to affect reward centres in the brain should be investigated as possible musical adaptations. It is concluded that the origins of music are complex and probably involved exaptation, cultural creation and evolutionary adaptation.',\n",

Veterinarians often hold decision-making positions in the public health care system, and therefore can influence public opinion about organ donation. The objective was to analyze the attitude of Spanish veterinary students toward LKRD because they may influence public opinion in the future, and to determine the factors that condition it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out among fifth-year veterinary science students from 2 southern and southeastern Spanish universities. The students' attitude toward LKRD was assessed using a psychosocial, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire. Statistics used were chi(2) test and Student t test. RESULTS: Data from the southern Spain university included a response rate of 87%. The survey showed that 94% of respondents would donate a kidney to a relative who needed it. This attitude toward LKRD was more favorable in women (P < .001) and in those who had discussed the subject with their families (P = .003). Nevertheless, only 58% would accept a kidney from a family member. Data from the southeastern Spain university included a response rate of 97%: 97% of the respondents would donate a kidney to a relative who needed it. This attitude was not associated with any psychosocial variables. However, only 58% would accept a kidney from a relative. There are no differences between the 2 universities (P = .879). CONCLUSIONS: Although the attitude of veterinary students from southern and southeastern Spain toward LKRD was very favorable and there are no differences between them, only 58% of the students would accept an organ from a relative.\",\n",

However, experiments and data analysis in this area are often extremely labor intensive, and it has often not been achievable or practical to perform properly standardized experiments on a statistically viable scale. We have addressed this challenge by developing automated live imaging platforms, to help standardize experiments, increasing throughput, and unlocking previously impossible ones. Our real-time cell tracking programs communicate in feedback with microscope and camera control software, and they are highly customizable, flexible, and efficient. As examples of our current research which utilize these automated platforms, we describe two quite different applications: egress-invasion interactions of malaria parasites and red blood cells, and imaging of immune cells which possess high motility and internal dynamics. The automated imaging platforms are able to track a large number of motile cells simultaneously, over hours or even days at a time, greatly increasing data throughput and opening up new experimental possibilities.',\n",

The biological characterization and dynamics of dormant parasites are not well understood. Here we report that following dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment in vitro, a small subset of morphologically dormant parasites was stained with rhodamine 123 (RH), a mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) marker, and persisted to recovery. FACS sorted RH-positive parasites resumed growth at 10,000/well while RH-negative parasites failed to recover at 5 million/well. Furthermore, transcriptional activity for mitochondrial enzymes was only detected in RH-positive dormant parasites. Importantly, after treating dormant parasites with different concentrations of atovaquone, a mitochondrial inhibitor, the recovery of dormant parasites was delayed or stopped. This demonstrates that mitochondrial activity is critical for survival and regrowth of dormant parasites and that RH staining provides a means of identifying these parasites. These findings provide novel paths for studying and eradicating this dormant stage.',\n",

High seropositivity is found in horses worldwide with approximately 3% viremic. NPHV natural history and molecular virology remain largely unexplored, however. Here, we show that NPHV, like HCV, can cause persistent infection for over a decade, with high titers and negative strand RNA in the liver. NPHV is a near-universal contaminant of commercial horse sera for cell culture. The complete NPHV 3'-UTR was determined and consists of interspersed homopolymer tracts and an HCV-like 3'-terminal poly(U)-X-tail. NPHV translation is stimulated by miR-122 and the 3'-UTR and, similar to HCV, the NPHV NS3-4A protease can cleave mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein to inactivate the retinoic acid-inducible gene I pathway. Using an NPHV consensus cDNA clone, replication was not observed in primary equine fetal liver cultures or after electroporation of selectable replicons. However, intrahepatic RNA inoculation of a horse initiated infection, yielding high RNA titers in the serum and liver. Delayed seroconversion, slightly elevated circulating liver enzymes and mild hepatitis was observed, followed by viral clearance. This establishes the molecular components of a functional NPHV genome. Thus, NPHV appears to resemble HCV not only in genome structure but also in its ability to establish chronic infection with delayed seroconversion and hepatitis. This NPHV infectious clone and resulting acute phase sera will facilitate more detailed studies on the natural history, pathogenesis, and immunity of this novel hepacivirus in its natural host.\",\n",

The use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high operational cost. Insecticides synthesized of natural products for vector control have been a priority in this area. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were green-synthesized using a floral extract of Chrysanthemum indicum screened for larvicidal and pupicidal activity against the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. The synthesized Ag NPs were characterized by using UV-vis absorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The textures of the yielded Ag NPs were found to be spherical and polydispersed with a mean size in the range of 25-59 nm. Larvae and pupae were exposed to various concentrations of aqueous extract of C. indicum and synthesized Ag NPs for 24 h, and the maximum mortality was observed from the synthesized Ag NPs against the vector A. stephensi (LC50 = 5.07, 10.35, 14.19, 22.81, and 35.05 ppm; LC90 = 29.18, 47.15, 65.53, 87.96, and 115.05 ppm).

We also performed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the effects of these factors on the risk of having low Hb (defined as Hb below the 10th percentile among men and women, respectively) and of a decrease in Hb greater than 0.5 mmol/L (0.8 g/dL) between successive donations. All analyses were performed stratified for sex and smoking status. We also tested a previously used model for the prediction of Hb. RESULTS: The strongest predictors of Hb and risk of low Hb were low ferritin (<15 ng/mL) and current use of iron supplementation (yes/no). No dietary factors were found to be consistently significant in multivariable models predicting Hb levels, risk of having low Hb, or risk of a decrease in Hb greater than 0.5 mmol/L. We found similar effects to previous studies of factors in the predictive model, with little additional effect of including smoking status and ferritin. CONCLUSIONS: As ferritin was the strongest predictor of Hb, this study supports the implementation of regular ferritin measurement as a method of risk assessment among blood donors.',\n",
        " 'Elevated serum levels of decoy receptor 3 are associated with disease severity in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.\\nHemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral infectious disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage and renal failure. HFRS has become a serious public health problem in China. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of HFRS has not been completely clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and to further explore its potential roles in HFRS. The levels of serum DcR3 were measured by sandwich ELISA. We found serum DcR3 levels increased significantly, which reached peak value during the oliguric phase and in the critical group. Moreover, serum DcR3 levels were closely related to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and parameters reflecting kidney injury including BUN, creatinine (Cr) and proteinuria. This study indicates that high levels of serum DcR3 have associations with the disease stages, severity and degree of kidney damage. Meanwhile, our results suggest that DcR3 may play a dual role in HFRS pathogenesis. First, DcR3 is involved in the inflammatory cascade response resulting in capillary permeability and kidney injury in the early stage. Secondly, HTNV infection induced DcR3 expression at the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in anti-inflammatory response. Thus, a study of DcR3 is essential for a better understanding of HFRS pathogenesis.',\n",
        " 'A Virtual Screen Discovers Novel, Fragment-Sized Inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis InhA.\\nIsoniazid (INH) is usually administered to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections, and is used in combination therapy to treat active tuberculosis disease (TB). Unfortunately, resistance to this drug is hampering its clinical effectiveness. INH is a prodrug that must be activated by Mtb catalase peroxidase (KatG) before it can inhibit InhA (Mtb enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase). Isoniazid-resistant cases of TB found in clinical settings usually involve mutations in or deletion of katG, which abrogate INH activation. Compounds that inhibit InhA without requiring prior activation by KatG would not be affected by this resistance mechanism and hence would display continued potency against these drug-resistant isolates of Mtb. Virtual screening experiments versus InhA in the GO Fight Against Malaria project (GO FAM) were designed to discover new scaffolds that display base stacking interactions with the NAD cofactor. GO FAM experiments included targets from other pathogens, including Mtb, when they had structural similarity to a malaria target. Eight of the sixteen soluble compounds identified by docking against InhA plus visual inspection were modest inhibitors and did not require prior activation by KatG. The best two inhibitors discovered are both fragment-sized compounds and displayed Ki values of 54 and 59 microM, respectively. Importantly, the novel inhibitors discovered have low structural similarity to known InhA inhibitors and, thus, help expand the number of chemotypes on which future medicinal chemistry efforts can be focused. These new fragment hits could eventually help advance the fight against INH-resistant Mtb strains, which pose a significant global health threat.',\n",
        " 'Status migrainosus as an initial presentation of multiple sclerosis.\\nBACKGROUND: Demyelinating plaques may induce headache through disruption of the pathways, which are implicated in the pathogeneses of migraine. We report a case of 25-year-old female patient, who presented with status migrainosus fulfilling the criteria of international classification of headache disorder. She was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) after an extensive work-up and long-term clinical and radiological follow-up. FINDINGS: At the onset of status migrainosus, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the presence of several demyelinating lesions fulfilling Swanton criteria. She was started on migraine prophylactic treatment but there was no subsequent response. One year later, she presented with recurrent status migrainosus and a follow-up MRI revealed multiple gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the brain. She was treated with abortive migraine medications. Within the following 2 year, she developed ascending parasthesia and weakness of both lower limbs indicative of incomplete transverse myelitis in association with recurrent status migrainosus. A diagnosis of MS was established based on a follow-up MRI that satisfied the revised 2010 McDonald criteria. Both the headache and neurological signs improved with IV methylprednisolone therapy. Her headache entered remission after initiation of a disease modifying therapy. CONCLUSION: Status migrainosus can be the initial presentation of MS. Unresponsiveness to migraine prophylactic therapy in the presence of active demyelinating plaque in MRI brain may pose a diagnostic challenge and a diagnosis of MS might be considered.',\n",
        " 'On the Functional Overlap between Complement and Anti-Microbial Peptides.\\nIntriguingly, activated complement and anti-microbial peptides share certain functionalities; lytic, phagocytic, and chemo-attractant activities and each may, in addition, exert cell instructive roles. Each has been shown to have distinct LPS detoxifying activity and may play a role in the development of endotoxin tolerance. In search of the origin of complement, a functional homolog of complement C3 involved in opsonization has been identified in horseshoe crabs. Horseshoe crabs possess anti-microbial peptides able to bind to acyl chains or phosphate groups/saccharides of endotoxin, LPS. Complement activity as a whole is detectable in marine invertebrates. These are also a source of anti-microbial peptides with potential pharmaceutical applicability. Investigating the locality for the production of complement pathway proteins and their role in modulating cellular immune responses are emerging fields. The significance of local synthesis of complement components is becoming clearer from in vivo studies of parenchymatous disease involving specifically generated, complement-deficient mouse lines. Complement C3 is a central component of complement activation. Its provision by cells of the myeloid lineage varies. Their effector functions in turn are increased in the presence of anti-microbial peptides. This may point to a potentiating range of activities, which should serve the maintenance of health but may also cause disease. Because of the therapeutic implications, this review will consider closely studies dealing with complement activation and anti-microbial peptide activity in acute inflammation (e.g., dialysis-related peritonitis, appendicitis, and ischemia).',\n",
        " 'Vitamin A supplements, routine immunization, and the subsequent risk of infection among children under 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nRecent studies, partly based on murine models, suggest childhood immunization and vitamin A supplements may confer protection against malaria infection, although strong evidence to support these theories in humans has so far been lacking. We analyzed national survey data from children aged 6-59 months in four sub-Saharan African countries over an 18-month time period, to determine the risk of Plasmodium spp. parasitemia (n=8390) and Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 (PfHRP-2)-related antigenemia (n=6121) following vitamin A supplementation and standard vaccination. Bacille Calmette Guerin-vaccinated children were more likely to be PfHRP-2 positive (relative risk [RR]=4.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.00-8.28). No association was identified with parasitemia. Measles and polio vaccination were not associated with malaria. Children receiving vitamin A were less likely to present with parasitemia (RR=0.46, 95% CI=0.39-0.54) and antigenemia (RR=0.23, 95% CI=0.17-0.29). Future studies focusing on climate seasonality, placental malaria and HIV are needed to characterize better the association between vitamin A and malaria infection in different settings.',\n",
        " \"Development and initial psychometric assessment of the reasons for pretending orgasm inventory.\\nResearch suggests that women pretend orgasm with their partner as a mate retention strategy, but the cognitive reasons behind this deception are not well known. To explore women's cognitive reasons for pretending orgasm, we first assembled a list of the reasons women report for pretending orgasm. We refined this list using independent data collected on performance frequencies for each item, followed by a principal components analysis, to generate the Reasons for Pretending Orgasm Inventory (RPOI). We found three components encompassing the cognitive reasons women pretend orgasm: Improve Partner's Experience (i.e., increasing the quality of the sexual experience for the partner), Deception and Manipulation (i.e., deceiving the partner or manipulating his perceptions for other gains), and Hiding Sexual Disinterest (i.e., sparing the partner's feelings about the woman's lack of sexual excitement). Discussion highlights limitations of this research and the RPOI, but suggests that the RPOI is useful as a structured means for assessing women's reasons for pretending orgasm.\",\n",
        " \"Functional brain response to food images in successful adolescent weight losers compared with normal-weight and overweight controls.\\nOBJECTIVE: Research conducted with adults suggests that successful weight losers demonstrate greater activation in brain regions associated with executive control in response to viewing high-energy foods. No previous studies have examined these associations in adolescents. Functional neuroimaging was used to assess brain response to food images among groups of overweight (OW), normal-weight (NW), and successful weight-losing (SWL) adolescents. METHODS: Eleven SWL, 12 NW, and 11 OW participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing images of high- and low-energy foods. RESULTS: When viewing high-energy food images, SWLs demonstrated greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared with OW and NW controls. Compared with NW and SWL groups, OW individuals demonstrated greater activation in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate in response to food images. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent SWLs demonstrated greater neural activation in the DLPFC compared with OW/NW controls when viewing high-energy food stimuli, which may indicate enhanced executive control. OW individuals' brain responses to food stimuli may indicate greater reward incentive processes than either SWL or NW groups.\",\n",
        " \"SAMHD1's protein expression profile in humans.\\nThe deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase and 3' --> 5' exonuclease SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 infection in noncycling hematopoietic cells in vitro, and SAMHD1 mutations are associated with AGS. Little is known about the in vivo expression and functional regulation of this cellular factor. Here, we first assessed the SAMHD1 protein expression profile on a microarray of 25 human tissues from >210 donors and in purified primary cell populations. In vivo, SAMHD1 was expressed in the majority of nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin, including tissue-resident macrophages, DCs, pDCs, all developmental stages of thymic T cells, monocytes, NK cells, as well as at lower levels in B cells. Of note, SAMHD1 was abundantly expressed in HIV target cells residing in the anogenital mucosa, providing a basis for its evaluation as a cellular factor that may impact the efficiency of HIV transmission. Next, we examined the effect of the activation status and proinflammatory cytokine treatment of cells on expression and phosphorylation of SAMHD1. Activated, HIV-susceptible CD4+ T cells carried pSAMHD1(T592), whereas resting CD4+ T cells and macrophages expressed the unphosphorylated protein with HIV-restrictive activity. Surprisingly, stimulation of these primary cells with IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-27, or TNF-alpha affected neither SAMHD1 expression levels nor threonine 592 phosphorylation. Only IL-1beta moderately down-regulated SAMHD1 in activated CD4+ T cells. Taken together, this study establishes the first cross-sectional protein expression profile of SAMHD1 in human tissues and provides insight into its cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation and unresponsiveness to multiple proinflammatory cytokines.\",\n",

Galectin-1 recently has been described to be involved in the maintenance of a tolerant environment, but there is no evidence of its role in human liver transplantation. The aim of our study was to measure the serum levels of galectin-1 in stable liver transplant recipients. METHODS: Serum levels of galectin-1 were determined in 30 stable liver transplant recipients who had been free of rejection episodes for at least 8 years. Fifteen patients with an acute rejection episode and 34 healthy subjects were used as the control group. RESULTS: The concentrations of galectin-1 were significantly higher in stable liver transplant recipients compared with healthy subjects and with the acute rejection group. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results indicate that galectin-1 is upregulated in stable liver transplant recipients. Thus, our results extend the recent findings that galectin-1 may play an immune-suppressive role in liver transplantation. It remains to be established whether it might help to induce tolerance in liver transplantation.',\n",
        " 'IFN-beta Treatment Requires B Cells for Efficacy in Neuroautoimmunity.\\nIFN-beta remains the most widely prescribed treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Despite widespread use of IFN-beta, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN-beta treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN-beta pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN-beta treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19+CD24++CD38++ transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN-beta-treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN-beta to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN-beta treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN-beta increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN-beta therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN-beta treatment. These results have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.',\n",

Following the limited results for conventional therapies, novel therapeutic agents are under investigation. Among the putative new molecules, gallic acid (GA) represents a promising new anticancer drug. The anticancer effect of this drug has been based on its antioxidant effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the toxic effects of GA on the T98G human glioblastoma cell line and its capacity to modulate the expression of microRNAs targeting the genes involved in tumor growth and invasion. Cytotoxicity, clonogenic ability and cell migration after GA treatment were tested. Moreover, the expression of miRNAs that target genes for antioxidant mitochondrial enzymes (mir-17-3p), p-21 protein (mir-21-5p) and ATM (mir-421-5p) was determined by qRT-PCR. The results confirmed in the T98G cells the anti-proliferative effect of GA reported for other glioma cell lines and showed that the miRNA expression changes depending on GA concentrations. Different GA concentrations can determine a protective or a toxic effect on tumor cells. Thus, the key for GA to induce a specific anticancer action is to use an optimal concentration that avoids these twin effects.',\n",
        " 'Spatial attention increases the pupillary response to light changes.\\nWe measured pupil size in adult human subjects while we manipulated both the luminance of the visual scene and the location of attention. We found that, with central fixation maintained, pupillary constrictions and dilations evoked by peripheral luminance increments and decrements are larger when spatial attention is covertly (i.e., with no eye movements) directed to the stimulus region versus when it is directed to the opposite hemifield. Irrespective of the size of the attended region (focused at the center of the stimulus or spread within and outside the stimulus), the attentional enhancement is large: more than 20% of the response to stimuli in the unattended hemifield. This indicates that a sizable portion of this simple ocular behavior-often considered a subcortical \"reflex\"-in fact depends on cortical processing. Together, these features indicate that pupillometry is not only an index of retinal and brainstem function, but also an objective measure of complex constructs such as attention and its effects on sensory processing.',\n",
        " 'Flow cytometric analysis of drug-induced basophil histamine release.\\nHistamine and its release can be studied by multicolor flow cytometry on a single cell level by an enzyme affinity method (HistaFlow(R)). However, for the time-being, the clinical and scientific application of the HistaFlow(R) technique remains limited. This study aims at verifying the reliability of the HistaFlow(R) as an instrument to quantify IgE-mediated basophil responses to drugs, i.e. rocuronium, which are believed to be less potent basophil activators than large proteinaceous allergens. Ten patients and three exposed control individuals were included in this study. Each subject underwent in vitro basophil activation tests (HistaFlow(R)) with 0.16 and 1.6 mmol/L rocuronium. Patients showed an activation of basophils ranging from 11 to 86% of CD63 positive basophils and a median histamine release per cell from 68 to 100% after stimulation with an optimal concentration of 1.6 mmol/L rocuronium. For the control individuals no activation was demonstrable. This study confirms that the HistaFlow(R) technique is a reliable tool to study histamine release by individual cells in response to drugs. Although the HistaFlow(R) technique will probably not add to the diagnostic management of rocuronium allergy, our findings suggest that the technique could constitute an important asset for future studies on the pathomechanism(s) of immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions.

        " \"Dairy intake is associated with brain glutathione concentration in older adults.\\nBACKGROUND: A reduction in key antioxidants such as glutathione has been noted in brain tissue undergoing oxidative stress in aging and neurodegeneration. To date, no dietary factor has been linked to a higher glutathione concentration. However, in an earlier pilot study, we showed evidence of a positive association between cerebral glutathione and dairy intake. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that dairy food consumption is associated with cerebral glutathione concentrations in older adults. DESIGN: In this observational study, we measured cerebral glutathione concentrations in 60 healthy subjects (mean +/- SD age: 68.7 +/- 6.2 y) whose routine dairy intakes varied. Glutathione concentrations were measured by using a unique, noninvasive magnetic resonance chemical shift imaging technique at 3 T and compared with dairy intakes reported in 7-d food records. RESULTS: Glutathione concentrations in the frontal [Spearman's rank-order correlation (rs) = 0.39, P = 0.013], parietal (rs = 0.50, P = 0.001), and frontoparietal regions (rs = 0.47, P = 0.003) were correlated with average daily dairy servings. In particular, glutathione concentrations in all 3 regions were positively correlated with milk servings (P </= 0.013), and those in the parietal region were also correlated with cheese servings (P = 0.015) and calcium intake (P = 0.039). Dairy intake was related to sex, fat-free mass, and daily intakes of energy, protein, and carbohydrates. However, when these factors were controlled through a partial correlation, correlations between glutathione concentrations and dairy and milk servings remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Higher cerebral glutathione concentrations were associated with greater dairy consumption in older adults. One possible explanation for this association is that dairy foods may serve as a good source of substrates for glutathione synthesis in the human brain.\",\n",
        " 'Phenotypic profiling of CD8 + T cells during Plasmodium vivax blood-stage infection.\\nBackgroundFor a long time, the role of CD8+ T cells in blood-stage malaria was not considered important because erythrocytes do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins. While recent evidences suggest that CD8+ T cells may play an important role during the erythrocytic phase of infection by eliminating parasites, CD8+ T cells might also contribute to modulate the host response through production of regulatory cytokines. Thus, the role of CD8+ T cells during blood-stage malaria is unclear. Here, we report the phenotypic profiling of CD8+ T cells subsets from patients with uncomplicated symptomatic P. vivax malaria.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 20 Plasmodium vivax-infected individuals and 12 healthy individuals. Immunophenotyping was conducted by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of IFN- inverted question mark, TNF- inverted question mark and IL-10 were determined by ELISA/CBA. Unpaired t-test or Mann inverted question markWhitney test was used depending on the data distribution.Results P. vivax-infected subjects had lower percentages and absolute numbers of CD8+CD45RA+ and CD8+CD45RO+ T cells when compared to uninfected individuals (p inverted question mark inverted question mark inverted question mark0.0002). A significantly lower absolute number of circulating CD8+CD45+CCR7+ cells (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.002) was observed in P. vivax-infected individuals indicating that infection reduces the number of central memory T cells. Cytokine expression was significantly reduced in the naive T cells from infected individuals compared with negative controls, as shown by lower numbers of IFN- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.001), TNF- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.0001) and IL-10+ (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.0001) CD8+ T cells. Despite the reduction in the number of CD8+ memory T cells producing IFN- inverted question mark (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.0001), P. vivax-infected individuals demonstrated a significant increase in memory CD8+TNF- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.016) and CD8+IL-10+ (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.004) cells. Positive correlations were observed between absolute numbers of CD8+IL-10+ and numbers of CD8+IFN- inverted question mark+ (p inverted question mark< inverted question mark0.001) and CD8+TNF- inverted question mark+ T cells (p inverted question mark inverted question mark inverted question mark0.0001). Finally, an increase in the plasma levels of TNF- inverted question mark (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.017) and IL-10 (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.006) and a decrease in the IFN- inverted question mark plasma level (p <0.0001) were observed in the P. vivax-infected individuals.Conclusions P. vivax infection reduces the numbers of different subsets of CD8+ T cells, particularly the memory cells, during blood-stage of infection and enhances the number of CD8+ memory T cells expressing IL-10, which positively correlates with the number of cells expressing TNF- inverted question mark and IFN- inverted question mark.',\n",

We sought to determine the prevalence of vertical HIV transmission in an urban cohort of HIV-exposed infants and describe cases of vertical HIV infection presenting during and after the neonatal period. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included HIV-exposed infants born between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2012, who received care at an urban referral site. RESULTS: There were 516 infants with HIV exposure known by the time of delivery; 9 of these infants (1.7%; 95% confidence interval: 0.8%-3.3%) were HIV infected. The HIV infection rate was 0.7% for those receiving prenatal antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and 9.3% for those receiving only intrapartum and/or postnatal ARV therapy. Among those diagnosed with HIV at delivery, 46% received no prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that strategies to eliminate infant HIV infections ought to include ensuring better access to prenatal care, HIV testing, and ARV therapy initiation during pregnancy.',\n",
        " 'Phylogenomics with paralogs.\\nPhylogenomics heavily relies on well-curated sequence data sets that comprise, for each gene, exclusively 1:1 orthologos. Paralogs are treated as a dangerous nuisance that has to be detected and removed. We show here that this severe restriction of the data sets is not necessary. Building upon recent advances in mathematical phylogenetics, we demonstrate that gene duplications convey meaningful phylogenetic information and allow the inference of plausible phylogenetic trees, provided orthologs and paralogs can be distinguished with a degree of certainty. Starting from tree-free estimates of orthology, cograph editing can sufficiently reduce the noise to find correct event-annotated gene trees. The information of gene trees can then directly be translated into constraints on the species trees. Although the resolution is very poor for individual gene families, we show that genome-wide data sets are sufficient to generate fully resolved phylogenetic trees, even in the presence of horizontal gene transfer.',\n",
        " 'Viremic and virologically suppressed HIV infection increases age-related changes to monocyte activation equivalent to 12 and 4 years of ageing respectively.\\nBACKGROUND:: Chronic inflammation and immune activation occur in both HIV infection and normal ageing and are associated with inflammatory disease. However, the degree to which HIV influences age-related innate immune changes, and the biomarkers which best reflect them, remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS:: We measured established innate immune ageing biomarkers in 309 individuals including 88 virologically-suppressed (VS) and 52 viremic (viral load </= and >50 copies/ml respectively) HIV+ individuals. Levels of soluble (ie. CXCL10, soluble CD163, neopterin) and cellular (ie. proportions of inflammatory CD16+ monocytes) biomarkers of monocyte activation were increased in HIV+ individuals and were only partially ameliorated by viral suppression. Viremic and VS HIV+ individuals show levels of age-related monocyte activation biomarkers that are similar to uninfected controls aged 12 and 4 years older respectively. Viremic HIV infection was associated with an accelerated rate of change of some monocyte activation markers (eg. neopterin) with age, whilst in VS individuals, subsequent age-related changes occurred at a similar rate as in controls, albeit at a higher absolute level. We further identified CXCL10 as a robust soluble biomarker of monocyte activation, highlighting the potential utility of this chemokine as a prognostic marker. IMPLICATIONS:: These findings may partially explain the increased prevalence of inflammatory, age-related diseases in HIV+ individuals and potentially indicate the pathological mechanisms underlying these diseases which persist despite viral suppression.',\n",
        " 'Modulation of nicotine effects on selective attention by DRD2 and CHRNA4 gene polymorphisms.\\nRATIONALE: Pharmacological and genetic modulation of cholinergic nicotinic neurotransmission influence visuospatial attention in humans. Prior studies show that nicotine as well as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene coding for the alpha 4 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA4) modulate visuospatial attention and distractor interference. The CHRNA4 gene synergistically interacts with a polymorphism in the dopaminergic receptor type d2 (DRD2) gene and impacts brain structure and cognition. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether CHRNA4 and DRD2 genotypes alter the effects of nicotine on distractor interference. METHODS: Fifty-eight young healthy non-smokers were genotyped for CHRNA4 (rs1044396) and DRD2 (rs6277). They received either 7 mg transdermal nicotine or a matched placebo in a double-blind, within-subject design 1 h prior to performing a visual search task with distractors. RESULTS: In isolation, DRD2 but not CHRNA4 genotype modulated the effects of nicotine on distractor interference with DRD2 CC carriers showing the strongest reduction of distractor interference after nicotine administration. A further analysis provided additional evidence that this effect was driven by those subjects, who carried at least one C allele in the CHRNA4 gene. CONCLUSION: The effects of nicotine on distractor interference are modulated synergistically by cholinergic and dopaminergic genetic variations. Hence, both genes may contribute to the often reported individual variability in cognitive and neural effects of nicotine.',\n",

        " 'An intermolecular electrostatic interaction controls the prepore-to-pore transition in a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin.\\nbeta-Barrel pore-forming toxins (betaPFTs) form an obligatory oligomeric prepore intermediate before the formation of the beta-barrel pore. The molecular components that control the critical prepore-to-pore transition remain unknown for betaPFTs. Using the archetype betaPFT perfringolysin O, we show that E183 of each monomer within the prepore complex forms an intermolecular electrostatic interaction with K336 of the adjacent monomer on completion of the prepore complex. The signal generated throughout the prepore complex by this interaction irrevocably commits it to the formation of the membrane-inserted giant beta-barrel pore. This interaction supplies the free energy to overcome the energy barrier (determined here to be approximately 19 kcal/mol) to the prepore-to-pore transition by the coordinated disruption of a critical interface within each monomer. These studies provide the first insight to our knowledge into the molecular mechanism that controls the prepore-to-pore transition for a betaPFT.',\n",
        " 'Suitability of Capillary Blood for Quantitative Assessment of G6PD Activity and Performances of G6PD Point-of-Care Tests.\\nThe use of primaquine and other 8-aminoquinolines for malaria elimination is hampered by, among other factors, the limited availability of point-of-care tests for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency. Historically, the most used source of blood for G6PD analyses is venous blood, whereas diagnostic devices used in the field require the use of capillary blood; data have shown that the two sources of blood often differ with respect to hemoglobin concentration and number of red blood cells. Therefore, we have analyzed, in both capillary and venous blood drawn from the same healthy donors, the correlation of G6PD activity assessed by two qualitative tests (the Fluorescent Spot test and the CareStart test) with the gold standard quantitative spectrophotometric assay. Results obtained on 150 subjects with normal, intermediate, and deficient G6PD phenotypes show that, although differences exist between the aforementioned characteristics in capillary and venous blood, these do not impact on the quantitative assessment of G6PD activity after corrected for hemoglobin concentration or red blood cell count. Furthermore, we have assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the two qualitative tests against the gold standard spectrophotometric assay at different activity thresholds of residual enzymatic activity in both blood sources.',\n",
        " 'The effects of Ins2(Akita) diabetes and chronic angiotensin II infusion on cystometric properties in mice.\\nAIMS: Diabetes is associated with both dysfunction of the lower urinary tract (LUT) and overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Although it is well known that the RAS affects normal LUT function, very little is known about RAS effects on the diabetic LUT. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of chronic angiotensin II (AngII) treatment on the LUT in a model of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Ins2(Akita) diabetic mice (20 weeks old) and their age-matched background controls underwent conscious cystometric evaluation after 4 weeks of chronic AngII treatment (700 ng/kg/min by osmotic pump) or vehicle (saline). RESULTS: Diabetic mice had compensated LUT function with bladder hypertrophy. Specifically, micturition volume, residual volume, and bladder capacity were all increased, while voiding efficiency and pressure generation were unchanged as bladder mass, contraction duration, and phasic urethral function were increased. AngII significantly increased voiding efficiency and peak voiding pressure and decreased phasic frequency irrespective of diabetic state and, in diabetic but not normoglycemic control mice, significantly decreased residual volume and increased contraction duration and nonphasic contraction duration. CONCLUSIONS: The Ins2(Akita) diabetic mice had compensated LUT function at 20 weeks of age. Even under these conditions, AngII had beneficial effects on LUT function, resulting in increased voiding efficiency. Future studies should therefore be conducted to determine whether AngII can rescue the decompensated LUT function occurring in end-stage diabetic uropathy.',\n",
        " 'Macrophage Mitochondrial and Stress Response to Ingestion of Cryptococcus neoformans.\\nHuman infection with Cryptococcus neoformans, a common fungal pathogen, follows deposition of yeast spores in the lung alveoli. The subsequent host-pathogen interaction can result in eradication, latency, or extrapulmonary dissemination. Successful control of C. neoformans infection is dependent on host macrophages, but macrophages display little ability to kill C. neoformans in vitro. Recently, we reported that ingestion of C. neoformans by mouse macrophages induces early cell cycle progression followed by mitotic arrest, an event that almost certainly reflects host cell damage. The goal of the present work was to understand macrophage pathways affected by C. neoformans toxicity. Infection of macrophages by C. neoformans was associated with alterations in protein translation rate and activation of several stress pathways, such as hypoxia-inducing factor-1-alpha, receptor-interacting protein 1, and apoptosis-inducing factor. Concomitantly we observed mitochondrial depolarization in infected macrophages, an observation that was replicated in vivo. We also observed differences in the stress pathways activated, depending on macrophage cell type, consistent with the nonspecific nature of C. neoformans virulence known to infect phylogenetically distant hosts. Our results indicate that C. neoformans infection impairs multiple host cellular functions and undermines the health of these critical phagocytic cells, which can potentially interfere with their ability to clear this fungal pathogen.',\n",

Transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasonography used to identify SCD patients at risk of stroke may contribute to significantly reducing morbidity and mortality in these patients by indicating appropriate treatment. From March 2008 to February 2013, we conducted systematic screening for cerebral vasculopathy using TCD in 572 SCD patients (including 375 SS, 144 SC, 26 S/beta0, and 27 S/beta+ thalassemia patients) aged 1-17 years in a comprehensive center for follow-up and research on sickle cell disease in Bamako, Mali. After exclusion of 30 inadequate results and one case of abnormal TCD observed in a multiple organ failure patient, we found an abnormal or conditional TCD in 18% of 541 children examined in a steady state. The highest prevalence of abnormal cases concerned homozygous SS patients (8.1%). No case of abnormal or conditional TCD was observed in children with S/beta+ thalassemia. Hemoglobin concentrations were significantly lower in patients with conditional or abnormal TCD (P<0.01). In a subgroup of 68 patients with conditional TCD, nine (13%) converted to abnormal TCD over 1 year. In this subgroup of 68 conditional TCD patients, a decrease or increase in baseline hemoglobin concentration was predictive of conditional or abnormal TCD at the follow-up visit. Progression towards conditional TCD was observed in four patients (0.9%) who initially had normal TCD. Children with abnormal TCD had, whenever possible, a monthly exchange transfusion program. One case of transient stroke in the context of P. falciparum malaria with low hemoglobin concentration and one death were observed. These findings highlight the need for systematic TCD in sickle cell disease monitoring and implementing regular blood transfusion programs in the context of limited access to regular and secure blood transfusions.',\n",
        " 'Dendritic Cell-Derived Exosomes may be a Tool for Cancer Immunotherapy by Converting Tumor Cells into Immunogenic Targets.\\nDendritic cells (DCs) have been attracting attention in cancer immunotherapy because of their role in inducing and modulating effective immune responses. Besides the direct contact with other cell types and the secretion of cytokines, it is becoming clear that nanovesicles, such as exosomes (Exo), secreted by DCs also have a role in their function. Conversely, tumor-derived Exo carry antigens and have been used as a source of specific stimulus for the immune response against tumors. At the same time, several works have shown that different cells types incorporate DC-derived Exo (DC-Exo), resulting in modifications of their phenotype and function. Since DC-Exo carry many of the immune function-associated molecules of DCs, their incorporation by tumor cells could turn tumor cells into immunogenic targets. We have, therefore, treated human breast adenocarcinoma cells (SK-BR-3) with DCs-Exo and used these to stimulate previously SK-BR-3-primed CD3(+) T-cells. Sensitized T-cells cultured with DC-Exo-treated tumor cells showed a significantly higher percentage of IFN-gamma-secreting cells (as measured by ELISPOT), when compared to the frequency of cells responding to non-DC-Exo-treated cells. These data show that the incorporation of DC-Exo by the tumor cells increased their ability to activate T-cells for a possibly more effective response, thus showing that DC-Exo may become another tool in cancer immunotherapy.',\n",

The current study investigated MMN in pigeons (Columba livia L) through intracranial recordings from Field L of the caudomedial nidopallium, the avian functional equivalent of the mammalian primary auditory cortex. Auditory evoked field potentials were recorded from awake birds using a low-frequency (800 Hz) and high-frequency (1400 Hz) deviant auditory oddball procedure with deviant-as-standard (flip-flop design) and multiple-standard control conditions. An MMN-like field potential was recorded and blocked with systemic 5 mg/kg ketamine administration. Our results are similar to human and rodent findings of an MMN-like event-related potential in birds suggestive of similar auditory sensory memory mechanisms in birds and mammals that are homologue from a common ancestor 300 million years ago or resulted from convergent evolution.',\n",

        " \"Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale in women: Psychometric properties.\\nOne individual's actions may affect the evolutionary fitness of another individual. Sexually antagonistic coevolution occurs when one partner's behavior decreases the fitness of the other partner (Rice, 1996). This conflict pressures the other partner to counter these disadvantageous actions. Mate guarding is a mate retention tactic aimed at keeping a partner from cheating. Mate guarding may reduce mate choice, especially for extra pair mates. Therefore, some individuals may resist their partner's mate guarding tactics. We developed a scale to measure resistance to mate guarding and tested it in women (N = 1069). Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), six theoretically sound factors emerged and explained 69% of the variance. Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed strong support for the six original subscales as well as for the overall scale. The subscales had high reliability. The validity of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale was also excellent. Women who stated they used more resistance to mate guarding strategies also indicated that they had partners who mate guarded more, were less invested in their relationships, felt their partners were more controlling, had a more avoidant attachment style, and had a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation.\",\n",

Pseudomonas biofilms are refractory to antibacterials and to phagocytic cells of innate immunity, leading to refractory infection. Little is known about the interaction between antipseudomonal agents and phagocytic cells in eradication of P. aeruginosa biofilms. Herein, we investigated the capacity of three antipseudomonal agents, amikacin (AMK), ceftazidime (CAZ) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), to interact with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) against biofilms and planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from sputa of CF patients. Three of the isolates were resistant and three were susceptible to each of these antibiotics. Concentrations 2, 8 and 32mg/l studied were subinhibitory for biofilms of resistant isolates; whereas, for biofilms of susceptible isolates they ranged between sub-MIC to 2xMIC values. The activity of each antibiotic alone or in combination with human PMNs against 48-hour mature biofilms or planktonic cells was determined by XTT [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] assay. All combinations of AMK with PMNs resulted in synergistic or additive effects against planktonic cells and biofilms of P. aeruginosa isolates as compared to each component alone. More than 75% of CAZ combinations exhibited additive interactions against biofilms of P. aeruginosa isolates; whereas, CIP had mostly antagonistic or no interaction with PMNs against biofilms of P. aeruginosa. Our findings demonstrate a greater positive interaction between AMK with PMNs than that observed for CAZ and especially CIP against isolates of P. aeruginosa from the respiratory tract of CF patients.',\n",
        " 'Comparison of mercury blood pressure readings with oscillometric and central blood pressure in predicting target organ damage in youth.\\nOBJECTIVE: Hypertension (HT) is an important risk factor for target organ damage (TOD). New methods for measuring BP are replacing mercury sphygmomanometry in many clinics. We examined the utility of different BP measurement techniques in predicting subclinical TOD in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Participants in a study of the cardiovascular effects of obesity and type 2 diabetes were evaluated (N=677, 18+/-3.3 years, 35% male, 60% non-White, 30% with type 2 diabetes). We measured adiposity, laboratory data, left ventricular mass, carotid intima-media thickness, and pulse wave velocity. BP was measured three times by mercury sphygmomanometry (BPm), using an oscillometric device (BPo), and by arterial tonometry to measure central aortic BP (BPc). Participants were stratified as normotensive, prehypertensive, or hypertensive. RESULTS: The prevalence of HT in this cohort with a mean BMI of 31 was the highest on BPo measurement (16%), followed by BPm (11%) and BPc (9%; P</=0.001) measurements. BPm was the most consistent in differentiating left ventricular mass and pulse wave velocity among participants in the prehypertensive group as compared with the normotensive and hypertensive groups. Mercury BP measurement was also more sensitive and specific at predicting greater left ventricular mass, pulse wave velocity, and carotid thickness compared with other BP measurement techniques in logistic regression. CONCLUSION: We conclude that mercury sphygmomanometry should remain the gold standard for evaluation of HT and the risk for TOD in adolescents and young adults.',\n",

However, its main limitation is the shortage of available organs. Therefore, it is necessary to join forces to achieve optimal deceased donation and prevent the loss of potential donors. We sought to analyze the acceptance of deceased organ donation (OD) among hospital personnel in surgical units in hospitals in Spain and Latin America. METHOD: A random sample (n = 554) was taken was stratified according to surgical services and job category in 12 hospitals-4 in Spain (n = 294 participants), 5 in Mexico (n = 202), 2 in Cuba (n = 41), and 1 in Costa Rica (n = 17). Attitude was assessed using a questionnaire validated, which was completed anonymously and self-administered. The chi(2) test, Student t test, and a logistic regression analysis were used. RESULTS: Overall, 75% of respondents (n = 417) were in favor of deceased OD and 25% were against it (n = 137). Regarding the respondent's country, there was a favorable attitude among 88% of Cubans, 85% of Mexicans, 82% of Costa Ricans, and 67% of Spaniards (P < .001). The physicians were most in favor of OD with 87% supporting it (n = 149), followed by nurses (n = 182) and ancillary personnel (n = 28) both at 74%, and the health care assistants at 59% (n = 58; P < .001). The following factors affect attitude toward OD: young age (37 +/- 10 years; P = .001), being a male (P = .018), having an unstable job situation (P = .009), a belief that one might need a future transplant (P = .036), having a favorable attitude toward living donation (P < .001), being in favor of donating a family member's organs (P < .001), having had a family discussion about OD (P < .001), and a partner's favorable attitude (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Attitude toward OD among surgeons in hospitals in Spain and Latin America was not as favorable as we might have expected.\",\n",

Discrepancy-plus-search is the spontaneous processing of PM cues via disruptions in processing fluency of ongoing task items. We tested whether this mechanism can be demonstrated in an ongoing rating task with a dominant semantic context. Ongoing task items were manipulated such that the PM cues were members of a semantic category (i.e., Body Parts) that was congruent or discrepant with the dominant semantic category in the ongoing task. Results showed that participants correctly responded to more PM cues when there was a category discrepancy between the PM cues and ongoing task items. Moreover, participants' identification of PM cues was accompanied by faster ongoing task reaction times when PM cues were discrepant with ongoing task items than when they were congruent. These results suggest that a discrepancy-plus-search process supports PM retrieval in certain contexts, and that some discrepancy-plus-search mechanisms may result from the violation of processing expectations within a semantic context.\",\n",
        " 'Effect of Self-Efficacy on Weight Loss: A Psychosocial Analysis of a Community-Based Adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention.\\nObjective. Weight loss is the most effective approach to reducing diabetes risk. It is a research priority to identify factors that may enhance weight loss success, particularly among those at risk for diabetes. This analysis explored the relationships between self-efficacy, weight loss, and dietary fat intake among adults at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Methods. This pilot, site-randomized trial was designed to compare group-based Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention delivery by YMCA staff to brief counseling alone (control) in 92 adults at risk for diabetes (BMI >/= 24 kg/m2, >/= 2 diabetes risk factors, and a random capillary blood glucose of 110-199 mg/dl). Self-efficacy was measured using the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle questionnaire. Data were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. A paired t test was used to determine within-group changes in self-efficacy and weight at 6 and 12 months. Using a fitted model, we estimated how much of an increase in self-efficacy was related to a 5% weight reduction at 6 and 12 months. Results. Self-efficacy was associated with a 5% reduction in baseline weight at 6 and 12 months but was not related to fat intake. Conclusion. These findings suggest that it is important to assess the level of self-efficacy when counseling adults at high risk for diabetes about weight loss. Certain aspects of self-efficacy seem to play a greater role, depending on the stage of weight loss.',\n",
        " \"Finding the beat: a neural perspective across humans and non-human primates.\\nHumans possess an ability to perceive and synchronize movements to the beat in music ('beat perception and synchronization'), and recent neuroscientific data have offered new insights into this beat-finding capacity at multiple neural levels. Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (including direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization-continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.\",\n",
        " 'The evolution of genomic GC content undergoes a rapid reversal within the genus Plasmodium.\\nThe genome of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is extremely AT rich. This bias toward a low GC content is a characteristic of several, but not all, species within the genus Plasmodium. We compared 4283 orthologous pairs of protein-coding sequences between Plasmodium falciparum and the less AT-biased Plasmodium vivax. Our results indicate that the common ancestor of these two species was also extremely AT rich. This means that, although there was a strong bias toward A+T during the early evolution of the ancestral Plasmodium lineage, there was a subsequent reversal of this trend during the more recent evolution of some species, such as P. vivax. Moreover, we show that not only is the P. vivax genome losing its AT richness, it is actually gaining a very significant degree of GC richness. This example illustrates the potential volatility of nucleotide content during the course of molecular evolution. Such reversible fluxes in nucleotide content within lineages could have important implications for phylogenetic reconstruction based on molecular sequence data.',\n",

Recently, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm), also known as a \"smart\" polymer, has been proposed as a potential adjuvant for making antibodies and vaccines. This material exhibits efficient delivery, protection against degradation, and preservation of antigen epitopes. In this work, we used both CFA and smart polymer to develop a highly specific murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant truncated histidine rich protein2 (HRP2) of P.falciparum. Our results indicate that the mAbs developed using these adjuvants were able to recognize recombinant HRP2 and native PfHRP2 protein from spent medium. The mAbs generated against recombinant truncated HRP2 showed better sensitivity to the antigen and importantly mAbs generated through PNiPAAm adjuvant were in the range of 108 to 109 M-1 . The mAbs generated through PNiPAAm are very efficient and sensitive in detecting HRP2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such comparison having been made between these two adjuvants and we propose that the smart polymer has huge potential as an alternative to CFA. Additionally, we discuss the utility of the mAbs generated through PNiPAAm for specific diagnosis of malaria caused by P.falciparum.',\n",

Music, by contrast, can be defined as a social and cultural construct based on that very musicality. One critical challenge is to delineate the constituent elements of musicality. What biological and cognitive mechanisms are essential for perceiving, appreciating and making music? Progress in understanding the evolution of music cognition depends upon adequate characterization of the constituent mechanisms of musicality and the extent to which they are present in non-human species. We argue for the importance of identifying these mechanisms and delineating their functions and developmental course, as well as suggesting effective means of studying them in human and non-human animals. It is virtually impossible to underpin the evolutionary role of musicality as a whole, but a multicomponent perspective on musicality that emphasizes its constituent capacities, development and neural cognitive specificity is an excellent starting point for a research programme aimed at illuminating the origins and evolution of musical behaviour as an autonomous trait.',\n",

Later, by implementing five metrics, we investigated the genome-wide signatures for positive natural selection of these Orang Asli, respectively. Finally, we searched for evidence of genomic adaptation to the pressure of malaria infection. We observed that different evolutionary responses might have emerged in the different Orang Asli communities to mitigate malaria infection.',\n",

Here, by cryoEM of KSHV at 6-A resolution, we show that SCP forms a crown on each hexon and uses a kinked helix to cross-link neighboring MCP subunits. SCP-null mutation decreased viral titer by 1,000 times and impaired but did not fully abolish capsid assembly, indicating an important but nonessential role of SCP. By truncating the C-terminal half of SCP and performing cryoEM reconstruction, we demonstrate that SCP's N-terminal half is responsible for the observed structure and function whereas the C-terminal half is flexible and dispensable. Serial truncations further highlight the critical importance of the N-terminal 10 aa, and cryoEM reconstruction of the one with six residues truncated localizes the N terminus of SCP in the cryoEM density map and enables us to construct a pseudoatomic model of SCP. Fitting of this SCP model and a homology model for the MCP upper domain into the cryoEM map reveals that SCP binds MCP largely via hydrophobic interactions and the kinked helix of SCP bridges over neighboring MCPs to form noncovalent cross-links. These data support a mechanistic model that tumor herpesvirus SCP reinforces the capsid for genome packaging, thus acting as a cementing protein similar to those found in many bacteriophages.\",\n",

Hemizygocity for three RP genes (Rps5, Rps14, or Rps28), distinguished by the proximity of their corresponding protein to the ribosome's mRNA exit site, is associated with the most profound phenotype. This EB phenotype was fully rescued by BAC or cDNA complementation but not by the reduction of p53 levels, although such reduction was effective with most other RP-deleted clones corresponding to non-mRNA exit-site proteins. RNA-sequencing studies further revealed that undifferentiated ESCs hemizygous for Rps5 showed reduced expression levels of several mesoderm-specific genes as compared with wild-type counterparts. Together, these results reveal that RP gene dosage limits the differentiation, not the self-renewal, of mouse ESCs. They also highlight two separate mechanisms underlying this process, one of which is p53 independent.\",\n",

However, the reason for this remains unclear. Here we show that gut microbiota contribute to the age dependence of HBV immunity in a hydrodynamic transfection mouse model. Although adult (12-wk-old) C3H/HeN mice cleared HBV within 6 wk postinjection (wpi), their young (6-wk-old) counterparts remained HBV-positive at 26 wpi. Sterilization of gut microbiota from 6 to 12 wk of age using antibiotics prevented adult mice from rapidly clearing HBV. Young mice with the Toll-like-receptor (TLR) 4 mutation (C3H/HeJ) exhibited rapid HBV clearance. The results suggest that an immuno-tolerating pathway to HBV prevailed in young mice, before the establishment of gut bacteria, through a TLR4-dependent pathway and that the maturation of gut microbiota in adult mice stimulated liver immunity, resulting in rapid HBV clearance.',\n",

Human CYP 2D6 is highly polymorphic and decreased CYP 2D6 enzyme activity has been linked to decreased PQ anti-malarial activity. Despite the importance of CYP 2D metabolism on PQ efficacy, the exact role these enzymes play in PQ metabolism and pharmacokinetics has not been extensively studied in vivo. In this study, a series of PQ pharmacokinetic experiments were conducted in mice with differential CYP 2D metabolism including wild type (WT), CYP 2D knock out (KO), and humanized CYP 2D6 mice (KO/KI). Plasma and liver pharmacokinetic profiles from a single 20 mg/kg PQ dose differed significantly among the strains for PQ and carboxy-PQ. Additionally, due to the suspected role of phenolic metabolites in PQ efficacy, these were probed using reference standards. Levels of phenolic metabolites were highest in mice capable of metabolizing CYP 2D6 substrates (WT and KO/KI 2D6 mice).

        " 'IRGM3 contributes to immunopathology and is required for differentiation of antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells in experimental cerebral malaria.\\nIFNgamma drives antiparasite responses and immunopathology during infection with Plasmodium species. Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) are a class of IFNgamma-dependent proteins that are essential for cell autonomous immunity to numerous intracellular pathogens. However, it is currently unknown whether IRGs modulate responses during malaria. We have used the Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) model, in which mice develop experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), to study the roles of IRGM1 and IRGM3 in immunopathology. Induction of mRNA for Irgm1 and Irgm3 was found in the brains and spleens of infected mice at times of peak IFNgamma production. Irgm3-/-, but not Irgm1-/- mice, were completely protected from the development of ECM, and this protection was associated with decreased induction of inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreased recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells within the brain. Although antigen-specific proliferation of transferred CD8+ T cells was not diminished compared to WT recipients following PbA infection, T cells transferred into Irgm3-/- recipients showed a striking impairment of effector differentiation. Decreased induction of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4), as well as enhanced mRNA expression of type-I IFNs were found in the spleens of Irgm3-/- mice at day 4 post-infection. Together, these data suggest that protection from ECM pathology in Irgm3-/- mice occurs due to impaired generation of CD8+ effector function. This defect is non-intrinsic to CD8+ T cells. Instead, diminished T cell responses most likely result from defective initiation of inflammatory responses in myeloid cells.',\n",

Nine percent of adults aged 18 and over have diagnosed diabetes, and more than 8 in 10 of these adults had contact with a doctor or health care professional in the past 6 months. The percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes who were taking any medication to control their glucose levels increased with age. The percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes who had contact with an eye or foot care specialist in the past 12 months increased with age. Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, those aged 18-39 were the least likely to have had their blood pressure or blood cholesterol checked by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional during the past 12 months. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects 1 in 10 adults in the United States (1). Diabetes can affect multiple organs and lead to serious health complications (2). Ongoing medical care is recommended for persons of any age who have diabetes in order to manage levels of glucose, obtain preventive care services, and treat diabetes-related complications (2,3). This report describes differences by age in the utilization of selected medical care services among adults aged 18 and over with diagnosed diabetes, based on data from the 2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).',\n",

Lunasin inhibits NF-kappaB activation and thus pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator production in macrophages. In this study we demonstrate that lunasin can effectively suppress allergic airway inflammation in two murine models of asthma. In an OVA+Alum sensitization model, intranasal lunasin treatment at the time of OVA challenges significantly reduced total cells counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and eosinophilia, peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltration, goblet cell metaplasia and airway IL-4 production. In an OVA+LPS intranasal sensitization model, lunasin treatment either at the time of sensitization or challenge has similar effects in suppress allergic airway inflammation including significantly reduced total cell and eosinophil counts in BAL fluid, inflammatory gene Fizz1 expression in the lung, and IL-4 production by OVA re-stimulated cells from mediastinal lymph nodes. We further show that intranasal instillation of OVA+lunasin significantly increases OVA-specific regulatory T cell (Treg) accumulation in the lung comparing to OVA only treatment. Taken together, our results suggest lunasin as an anti-inflammatory agent can be potentially used in asthma therapy or as an adjuvant to enhance the induction of antigen-specific Tregs and thus boost the efficacy of allergy immunotherapy.',\n",

We assessed how house design may affect mosquito house entry and malaria risk in Uganda. METHODS: 100 households were enrolled in each of three sub-counties: Walukuba, Jinja district; Kihihi, Kanungu district; and Nagongera, Tororo district. CDC light trap collections of mosquitoes were done monthly in all homes. All children aged six months to ten years (n = 878) were followed prospectively for a total of 24 months to measure parasite prevalence every three months and malaria incidence. Homes were classified as modern (cement, wood or metal walls; and tiled or metal roof; and closed eaves) or traditional (all other homes). RESULTS: A total of 113,618 female Anopheles were collected over 6,765 nights. 6,816 routine blood smears were taken of which 1,061 (15.6%) were malaria parasite positive. 2,582 episodes of uncomplicated malaria were diagnosed after 1,569 person years of follow-up, giving an overall incidence of 1.6 episodes per person year at risk. The human biting rate was lower in modern homes than in traditional homes (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.64, p<0.001). The odds of malaria infection were lower in modern homes across all the sub-counties (adjusted odds ratio 0.44, 95%CI 0.30-0.65, p<0.001), while malaria incidence was lower in modern homes in Kihihi (adjusted IRR 0.61, 95%CI 0.40-0.91, p = 0.02) but not in Walukuba or Nagongera. CONCLUSIONS: House design is likely to explain some of the heterogeneity of malaria transmission in Uganda and represents a promising target for future interventions, even in highly endemic areas.',\n",

        " 'Diurnal cortisol and survival in epithelial ovarian cancer.\\nINTRODUCTION: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) deregulation is commonly observed in cancer patients, but its clinical significance is not well understood. We prospectively examined the association between HPA activity, tumor-associated inflammation, and survival in ovarian cancer patients prior to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were 113 women with ovarian cancer who provided salivary cortisol for three days prior to treatment for calculation of cortisol slope, variability, and night cortisol. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine associations between cortisol and survival in models adjusting for disease stage, tumor grade, cytoreduction and age. On a subsample of 41 patients with advanced disease ascites fluid was assayed for levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and correlated with cortisol variables. RESULTS: Each cortisol measure was associated with decreased survival time, adjusting for covariates (all p<.041). A one standard deviation increase in night cortisol was associated with a 46% greater likelihood of death. Patients in the high night cortisol group survived an estimated average of 3.3 years compared to 7.3 years for those in the low night cortisol group. Elevated ascites IL-6 was associated with each cortisol measure (all r>36, all p<.017). DISCUSSION: Abnormal cortisol rhythms assessed prior to treatment are associated with decreased survival in ovarian cancer and increased inflammation in the vicinity of the tumor. HPA abnormalities may reflect poor endogenous control of inflammation, dysregulation caused by tumor-associated inflammation, broad circadian disruption, or some combination of these factors. Nocturnal cortisol may have utility as a non-invasive measure of HPA function and/or disease severity.',\n",
        " 'A Novel Antimycobacterial Compound Acts as an Intracellular Iron Chelator.\\nEfficient iron acquisition is crucial for the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterial iron uptake and metabolism are therefore attractive targets for antitubercular drug development. Resistant mutations against a novel pyrazolopyrimidinone compound (PZP) that is active against M. tuberculosis have been identified within the gene cluster encoding the ESX-3 type VII secretion system. ESX-3 is required for mycobacterial iron acquisition through the mycobactin siderophore pathway, which could indicate that PZP restricts mycobacterial growth by targeting ESX-3 and thus iron uptake. Surprisingly, we show that ESX-3 is not the cellular target of the compound. We demonstrate that PZP indeed targets iron metabolism, however, we find that instead of inhibiting uptake of iron PZP acts as an iron chelator and we present evidence that the compound restricts mycobacterial growth by chelating intrabacterial iron. Thus, we have unraveled the unexpected mechanism of a novel antimycobacterial compound.',\n",
        " \"Diagnostic communication in the memory clinic: a conversation analytic perspective.\\nObjectives: Whether and how patients should be told their dementia diagnosis, has been an area of much debate. While there is now recognition that early diagnosis is important for dementia care little research has looked at how dementia-related diagnostic information is actually verbally communicated. The limited previous research suggests that the absence of explicit terminology (e.g., use of the term Alzheimer's) is problematic. This paper interrogates this assumption through a conversation analysis of British naturalistic memory clinic interaction. Method: This paper is based on video-recordings of communication within a UK memory clinic. Appointments with 29 patients and accompanying persons were recorded, and the corpus was repeatedly listened to, in conjunction with the transcripts in order to identify the segments of talk where there was an action hearable as diagnostic delivery, that is where the clinician is evaluating the patient's condition. Results: Using a conversation analytic approach this analysis suggests that diagnostic communication, which is sensitive and responsive to the patient and their carers, is not predicated on the presence or absence of particular lexical choices. There is inherent complexity regarding dementia diagnosis, especially in the 'early stages', which is produced through and reflected in diagnostic talk in clinical encounters. Conclusion: In the context of continuity of dementia care, diagnostic information is communicated in a way that conforms to intersubjective norms of minimizing catastrophic reactions in medical communication, and is sensitive to problems associated with 'insight' in terms of delivery and receipt or non-receipt of diagnosis.\",\n",
        " 'In situ hybridization and sequence analysis reveal an association of Plasmodium spp. with mortalities in wild passerine birds in Austria.\\nNative European passerine birds are frequently clinically inapparent carriers of haemosporidian parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Clinical disease and death are only exceptionally reported. In the present study, tissue samples of 233 wild passerine birds found dead in Eastern Austria were examined by in situ hybridization (ISH) and partial cytochrome B gene sequence analysis for the presence, abundance and taxonomic assignment of Plasmodium spp. In 34 cases (14.6 %), ISH yielded a positive result with large numbers of developmental stages in different cell types of the spleen, liver, brain and lung. The abundance of the tissue stages, which was comparable to fatal cases of avian malaria in penguins, suggested a major contribution to the cause of death. Genetic analysis revealed infections with representatives of three different valid species of Plasmodium, Plasmodium elongatum, Plasmodium lutzi and Plasmodium vaughani. Genetically identical parasite lineages had been found in a previous study in penguins kept in the Vienna zoo, providing evidence for the role of wild birds as reservoir hosts. Further, this study provides evidence that several species of Plasmodium are able to abundantly proliferate in endemic wild birds ultimately resulting in mortalities.',\n",

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to validate the Danish version of the PCS and to show that pain frequency moderates the relationship between pain catastrophizing and reported pain in both non-clinical and clinical populations.',\n",
        " \"Label-free Raman imaging of the macrophage response to the malaria pigment hemozoin.\\nHemozoin, the 'malaria pigment', is engulfed by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, during malaria infection. This biocrystalline substance is difficult to degrade and often accumulates in phagocytes. The macrophage response to hemozoin relates to the severity of the disease and the potential for malaria-related disease complications. In this study we have used Raman spectroscopy as a label-free method to investigate the biochemical changes occurring in macrophages during the first few hours of hemozoin uptake. We found a number of distinct spectral groups, spectrally or spatially related to the presence of the hemozoin inside the cell. Intracellular hemozoin was spectrally identical to extracellular hemozoin, regardless of the location in the cell. A small proportion of hemozoin was found to be associated with lipid-based components, consistent with the uptake of hemozoin into vesicles such as phagosomes and lysosomes. The spatial distribution of the hemozoin was observed to be inhomogeneous, and its presence largely excluded that of proteins and lipids, demonstrating that cells were not able to break down the biocrystals on the time scales studied here. These results show that Raman imaging can be used to answer some of the open questions regarding the role of hemozoin in the immune response. How different combinations of hemozoin and other molecules are treated by macrophages, whether hemozoin can be broken down by the cell, and more importantly, which co-factors or products are involved in the subsequent cell reaction are the expected issues to be elucidated by this technique.\",\n",

The antipyretic, antimalarial, haemostatic, anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties of their extracts enabled their use in the treatment of several diseases, such as fevers, colds, contusions, diarrhoea, mastitis, mumps, hepatitis, malaria, etc. This review summarises the state-of-the-art and comprehensive information surrounding its use as traditional medicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology to reveal the potential therapeutic effects of Carpesium plants and to establish a solid foundation for directing future research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extensive reading and investigation were actualized by systematically searching the scientific literatures including Chinese, Korean and Japanese herbal classics, library catalogs and scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, SciFinder and the Web of Science), were systematically searched for topics related to factors like the chemical constituents, pharmacognostic research and pharmacological effects of the Carpesium species. RESULTS: Carpesium plants have been studied extensively as traditional folk medicines in China, Korea and Japan all the time. In past, phytochemical research was the focal point of this genus, and the recent studies of the members of this genus have been focused on the pharmacological activity and potential therapeutic applications of these plants. The research performed revealed that 143 compounds including sesquiterpenoid lactone monomers, sesquiterpenoid lactone dimers, monoterpenes, diterpenoids, phenolic compounds, and several other type of compounds, were isolated and identified within this genus in recent years, and certain of these constituents had demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, anti-plasmodial, anti-oxidant, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial effects. CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that approximately 50 active compounds possess therapeutic potential during the treatment of cancer, inflammatory, parasitosis, etc. However, apart from those bioactive molecules, a considerable part of compounds, including a lot of sesquiterpenes, and several other type of compounds that have been previously isolated but have not been tested biologically need to be further tested. Therefore, more pharmacological experiments should be focused on these untested chemical constituents. Additionally, another issue concerns that most pharmacological studies were only performed in vitro-based experiments, so additional in vivo tests in animal models are required to estimate their side effects for the safety approval of therapeutic applications. Finally, further studies through well controlled, double-blind clinical trials are required to re-evaluate their efficacious and possible side effects, and more pharmacological mechanisms on main active compounds will also be needed for illuminating correlations between ehnopharmacology and pharmacology in future.',\n",

        " 'Suppressive interactions underlying visually evoked fixational saccades.\\nSmall saccades occur frequently during fixation, and are coupled to changes in visual stimulation and cognitive state. Neurophysiologically, fixational saccades reflect neural activity near the foveal region of a continuous visuomotor map. It is well known that competitive interactions between neurons within visuomotor maps contribute to target selection for large saccades. Here we asked how such interactions in visuomotor maps shape the rate and direction of small fixational saccades. We measured fixational saccades during periods of prolonged fixation while presenting pairs of visual stimuli (parafoveal: 0.8 deg eccentricity; peripheral: 5 deg eccentricity) of various contrasts. Fixational saccade direction was biased toward locations of parafoveal stimuli but not peripheral stimuli, approximately 100-250ms following stimulus onset. The rate of fixational saccades toward parafoveal stimuli (congruent saccades) increased systematically with parafoveal stimulus contrast, and was suppressed by the simultaneous presentation of a peripheral stimulus. The suppression was best characterized as a combination of two processes: a subtractive suppression of the overall fixational saccade rate and a divisive suppression of the direction bias. These results reveal the nature of suppressive interactions within visuomotor maps and constrain models of the population code for fixational saccades.',\n",
        " \"Vaccine design via nonnegative lasso-based variable selection.\\nThere are many different strains of malaria parasites, each represented by a unique sequence of amino acids. A desirable vaccine would match the amino acid sequence of the parasite antigen. Because of the three-dimensional structure of protein, not all sites in the amino acid sequence participate in the binding between the vaccine-induced antibody and the parasite antigen. Nor do all sites have equal importance. In this work, we apply a nonnegative lasso-based variable selection to identify the 'important' amino acid sites and evaluate their relative importance. We then define a metric, the functional coverage, to measure the 'effective' matching in the amino acid sequence between the vaccine and the parasite. With the variable selection procedure, development of a vaccine needs only to target the important sites, and the potential effectiveness of a vaccine candidate is reflected by the functional coverage.

Such a perspective has important implications for several topics of general interest besides evolutionary origins. For instance, neural overlap is an important premise for the possibility of music training to influence language acquisition and literacy. However, neural overlap in processing music and speech does not entail sharing neural circuitries. Neural separability between music and speech may occur in overlapping brain regions. In this paper, we review the evidence and outline the issues faced in interpreting such neural data, and argue that converging evidence from several methodologies is needed before neural overlap is taken as evidence of sharing.',\n",

        " \"Role of the motor system in language knowledge.\\nAll spoken languages express words by sound patterns, and certain patterns (e.g., blog) are systematically preferred to others (e.g., lbog). What principles account for such preferences: does the language system encode abstract rules banning syllables like lbog, or does their dislike reflect the increased motor demands associated with speech production? More generally, we ask whether linguistic knowledge is fully embodied or whether some linguistic principles could potentially be abstract. To address this question, here we gauge the sensitivity of English speakers to the putative universal syllable hierarchy (e.g., blif succeedsbnif succeedsbdif succeedslbif) while undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the cortical motor representation of the left orbicularis oris muscle. If syllable preferences reflect motor simulation, then worse-formed syllables (e.g., lbif) should (i) elicit more errors; (ii) engage more strongly motor brain areas; and (iii) elicit stronger effects of TMS on these motor regions. In line with the motor account, we found that repetitive TMS pulses impaired participants' global sensitivity to the number of syllables, and functional MRI confirmed that the cortical stimulation site was sensitive to the syllable hierarchy. Contrary to the motor account, however, ill-formed syllables were least likely to engage the lip sensorimotor area and they were least impaired by TMS. Results suggest that speech perception automatically triggers motor action, but this effect is not causally linked to the computation of linguistic structure. We conclude that the language and motor systems are intimately linked, yet distinct. Language is designed to optimize motor action, but its knowledge includes principles that are disembodied and potentially abstract.\",\n",
        " 'Time-to-infection by Plasmodium falciparum is largely determined by random factors.\\nBACKGROUND: The identification of protective immune responses to P. falciparum infection is an important goal for the development of a vaccine for malaria. This requires the identification of susceptible and resistant individuals, so that their immune responses may be studied. Time-to-infection studies are one method for identifying putative susceptible individuals (infected early) versus resistant individuals (infected late). However, the timing of infection is dependent on random factors, such as whether the subject was bitten by an infected mosquito, as well as individual factors, such as their level of immunity. It is important to understand how much of the observed variation in infection is simply due to chance. METHODS: We analyse previously published data from a treatment-time-to-infection study of 201 individuals aged 0.5 to 78 years living in Western Kenya. We use a mathematical modelling approach to investigate the role of immunity versus random factors in determining time-to-infection in this cohort. We extend this analysis using a modelling approach to understand what factors might increase or decrease the utility of these studies for identifying susceptible and resistant individuals. RESULTS: We find that, under most circumstances, the observed distribution of time-to-infection is consistent with this simply being a random process. We find that age, method for detection of infection (PCR versus microscopy), and underlying force of infection are all factors in determining whether time-to-infection is a useful correlate of immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Many epidemiological studies of P. falciparum infection assume that the observed variation in infection outcomes, such as time-to-infection or presence or absence of infection, is determined by host resistance or susceptibility. However, under most circumstances, this distribution appears largely due to the random timing of infection, particularly in children. More direct measurements, such as parasite growth rate, may be more useful than time-to-infection in segregating patients based on their level of immunity.',\n",

Phosphorothioate (PS) backbone modification of nucleotide-based drugs is common practice to protect these promising drug candidates from rapid degradation by plasma and intracellular nucleases. Effects of the changes in physicochemical properties associated with PS modification on platelets have not been elucidated so far. Here we report the unexpected binding of PS-modified oligonucleotides to platelets eliciting strong platelet activation, signaling, reactive oxygen species generation, adhesion, spreading, aggregation, and thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the platelet-specific receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) mediates these platelet-activating effects. Notably, platelets from GPVI function-deficient patients do not exhibit binding of PS-modified oligonucleotides, and platelet activation is fully abolished. Our data demonstrate a novel, unexpected, PS backbone-dependent, platelet-activating effect of nucleotide-based drug candidates mediated by GPVI. This unforeseen effect should be considered in the ongoing development programs for the broad range of upcoming and promising DNA/RNA therapeutics.',\n",
        " \"Chlamydial Lung Infection Induces Transient IL-9 Production Which Is Redundant for Host Defense against Primary Infection.\\nIL-9/Th9 responses are recently found to be important for innate and adaptive immunity particularly in parasitic infections. To date, the study on the role of IL-9 in bacterial infections is limited and the reported data are contradictory. One reported function of IL-9/Th9 is to modulate Th1/Th17 responses. Since our and others' previous work has shown a critical role of Th1 and Th17 cells in host defense against chlamydial lung infection, we here examined the role of IL-9 responses in Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) lung infection, particularly its effect on Th1 and Th17 responses and outcome infection. Our data showed quick but transient IL-9 production in the lung following infection, peaking at day 3 and back to baseline around day 7. CD4+ T cell was the major source of IL-9 production in the lung infection. Blockade of endogenous IL-9 using neutralizing antibody failed to change Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-17 production by cultured spleen mononuclear cells isolated from Cm infected mice. Similarly, in vivo neutralization of IL-9 failed to show significant effect on T cell (Th1 and Th17) and antibody responses (IgA, IgG1 and IgG2a). Consistently, the neutralization of IL-9 had no significant effect on disease process, including body weight change, bacterial burden and histopathological score. The data suggest that IL-9 production following chlamydial lung infection is redundant for host defense against the intracellular bacteria.\",\n",
        " 'Enantioselective Pharmacokinetics of Primaquine in Healthy Human Volunteers.\\nPrimaquine (PQ), a racemic drug, is the only treatment available for radical cure of relapsing vivax malaria and blocking transmission of falciparum malaria. Recently studies by us have shown differential pharmacologic and toxicologic profiles of individual PQ enantiomers. A study was conducted in six healthy adult human volunteers to determine plasma pharmacokinetic profile of enantiomers of PQ and carboxyprimaquine (cPQ), the major plasma metabolite. The individuals were orally administered with PQ diphosphate, equivalent to 45 mg base, 30 min after a normal breakfast. Blood samples were collected at different time intervals and plasma samples were analyzed for enantiomers of PQ & cPQ. Plasma PQ concentrations were low and variable for both parent enantiomers and peaked around 2-4 hrs. Peak (-)-PQ concentrations ranged from 121-221 ng/ml and peak (+)-PQ concentrations ranged from 168-299 ng/ml. cPQ concentrations were much higher and surprisingly consistent from subject to subject. Essentially all of the cPQ detected in plasma was (-)-cPQ. The peak concentrations of (-)-cPQ were observed at 8 hr (range 1104-1756 ng/ml); however, very high concentrations were sustained through 24 hr. (+)-cPQ was two orders of magnitude lower than (-)-cPQ, and in a few subjects it was only detected under the limit of quantification. The results suggest more rapid metabolism of (-)-PQ to (-) cPQ compared to (+)-PQ. Alternatively, (+)-PQ or (+)-cPQ could be rapidly converted to another metabolite(s) or distributed to tissues. This is the first clinical report on enantioselective pharmacokinetic profiles of PQ and cPQ and supports further clinical evaluation of individual PQ enantiomers.',\n",

METHODS: We present data from a large controlled trial of fluid resuscitation (Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial) on the prevalence, clinical features, and transfusion management of anaemia in children presenting to hospitals in three East African countries with serious febrile illness (predominantly malaria and/or sepsis) and impaired peripheral perfusion. RESULTS: Of 3,170 children in the FEAST trial, 3,082 (97%) had baseline haemoglobin (Hb) measurement, 2,346/3,082 (76%) were anaemic (Hb <10 g/dL), and 33% severely anaemic (Hb <5 g/dL). Prevalence of severe anaemia varied from 12% in Kenya to 41% in eastern Uganda. 1,387/3,082 (45%) children were transfused (81% within 8 hours). Adherence to WHO transfusion guidelines was poor. Among severely anaemic children who were not transfused, 52% (54/103) died within 8 hours, and 90% of these deaths occurred within 2.5 hours of randomisation. By 24 hours, 128/1,002 (13%) severely anaemic children had died, compared to 36/501 (7%) and 71/843 (8%) of those with moderate and mild anaemia, respectively. Among children without severe hypotension who were randomised to receive fluid boluses of 0.9% saline or albumin, mortality was increased (10.6% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to controls (7.2%), regardless of admission Hb level. Repeat transfusion varied from </=2% in Kenya/Tanzania to 6 to 13% at the four Ugandan centres. Adverse reactions to blood were rare (0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Severe anaemia complicates one third of childhood admissions with serious febrile illness to hospitals in East Africa, and is associated with increased mortality. A high proportion of deaths occurred within 2.5 hours of admission, emphasizing the need for rapid recognition and prompt blood transfusion. Adherence to current WHO transfusion guidelines was poor. The high rates of re-transfusion suggest that 20 mL/kg whole blood or 10 mL/kg packed cells may undertreat a significant proportion of anaemic children. Future evaluation of the impact of a larger volume of transfused blood and optimum transfusion management of children with Hb of <6 g/dL is warranted.Please see related article: http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-014-0248-5.',\n",

Maternal nutrition, pregnancy induced hypertension, chronic maternal infections, and other infections such as cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, rubella and malaria are the other causes of IUGR. The present study examines the secular trend of Small for Gestational Age (SGA) over 15 years and risk factors for SGA from a referral hospital in India.MethodsData from 1996 to 2010 was obtained from the labour room register. A rotational sampling scheme was used i.e. 12 months of the year were divided into 4 quarters. Taking into consideration all deliveries that met the inclusion criteria, babies whose birth weights were less than 10th percentile of the cut off values specific for gestational ages, were categorized as SGA. Only deliveries of live births that occurred between 22 and 42 weeks of pregnancy were considered in this study. Besides bivariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression analysis was done. Nagelkerke R2 statistics and Hosmer and Lemeshow chi-square statistics were used as goodness of fit statistics.ResultsBased on the data from 36,674 deliveries, the incidence of SGA was 11.4% in 1996 and 8.4% in 2010. Women who had multiple pregnancies had the higher odds of having SGA babies, 2.8 (2.3-3.3) times. The women with hypertensive disease had 1.8 (1.5-1.9) times higher odds of having SGA. Underweight women had 1.7 (1.3 - 2.1) times and anaemic mothers had 1.29 (1.01 - 1.6) times higher odds. The mothers who had cardiac disease were 1.4 (1.01 - 2.0) times at higher odds for SGA. In teenage pregnancies, the odds of SGA was 1.3 (1.1 - 1.5) times higher than mothers in the age group 20 to 35 years.ConclusionsThere is a significant reduction in the incidence of SGA by 26% over 15 years. The women with the above modifiable risk factors need to be identified early and provided with health education on optimal birth weight.',\n",
        " 'Compartmentalization of GABA Synthesis by GAD67 Differs between Pancreatic Beta Cells and Neurons.\\nThe inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is synthesized by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in neurons and in pancreatic beta-cells in islets of Langerhans where it functions as a paracrine and autocrine signaling molecule regulating the function of islet endocrine cells. The localization of the two non-allelic isoforms GAD65 and GAD67 to vesicular membranes is important for rapid delivery and accumulation of GABA for regulated secretion. While the membrane anchoring and trafficking of GAD65 are mediated by intrinsic hydrophobic modifications, GAD67 remains hydrophilic, and yet is targeted to vesicular membrane pathways and synaptic clusters in neurons by both a GAD65-dependent and a distinct GAD65-independent mechanism. Herein we have investigated the membrane association and targeting of GAD67 and GAD65 in monolayer cultures of primary rat, human, and mouse islets and in insulinoma cells. GAD65 is primarily detected in Golgi membranes and in peripheral vesicles distinct from insulin vesicles in beta-cells. In the absence of GAD65, GAD67 is in contrast primarily cytosolic in beta-cells; its co-expression with GAD65 is necessary for targeting to Golgi membranes and vesicular compartments. Thus, the GAD65-independent mechanism for targeting of GAD67 to synaptic vesicles in neurons is not functional in islet beta-cells. Therefore, only GAD65:GAD65 homodimers and GAD67:GAD65 heterodimers, but not the GAD67:GAD67 homodimer gain access to vesicular compartments in beta-cells to facilitate rapid accumulation of newly synthesized GABA for regulated secretion and fine tuning of GABA-signaling in islets of Langerhans.',\n",
        " 'Chemical and UV Mutagenesis.\\nThe ability to create mutations is an important step towards understanding bacterial physiology and virulence. While targeted approaches are invaluable, the ability to produce genome-wide random mutations can lead to crucial discoveries. Transposon mutagenesis is a useful approach, but many interesting mutations can be missed by these insertions that interrupt coding and noncoding sequences due to the integration of an entire transposon. Chemical mutagenesis and UV-based random mutagenesis are alternate approaches to isolate mutations of interest with the potential of only single nucleotide changes. Once a standard method, difficulty in identifying mutation sites had decreased the popularity of this technique. However, thanks to the recent emergence of economical whole-genome sequencing, this approach to making mutations can once again become a viable option. Therefore, this chapter provides an overview protocol for random mutagenesis using UV light or DNA-damaging chemicals.',\n",
        " 'Impact and cost of care of venous thromboembolism following pituitary surgery.\\nOBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: In 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discontinued reimbursement for postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) events such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, citing them as preventable postoperative complications. We examined the impact of postoperative VTE on patients undergoing pituitary surgery. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was evaluated for patients undergoing pituitary resection from 2002 to 2010. Patient demographics, comorbidities, length of stay, hospital charges, and postoperative complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients who underwent pituitary surgery developed a VTE. Patients who underwent pituitary surgery that developed VTE were older (55.9 +/- 15.2 years) than those who did not develop VTE (50.1 +/- 17.2 years) (P = 0.002). VTE occurred at a significantly higher rate in patients with coagulopathy, peripheral vascular disorder, and weight loss (P < 0.05). VTE was associated with increased rates of postoperative neurological, pulmonary, cardiac, urinary, renal, hemorrhage, fluid and electrolytes, diabetes insipidus, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea complications (P < 0.01)-as well as increased mortality rate (P < 0.001), length of stay (P < 0.001), and cost of care (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the data from the NIS database showed that risk factors for the development of VTE following pituitary surgery include older age, preexisting coagulopathy, peripheral vascular disorder, and weight loss. Patients who developed postoperative VTE had a longer length of hospital stay, higher hospital charges, and increased morbidity and mortality. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2C. Laryngoscope, 2015.',\n",

        " \"Less is more: the design of early-warning scoring systems affects the speed and accuracy of scoring.\\nAIM: To evaluate the effect of early-warning scoring system design on the speed and accuracy of scoring. BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread implementation of early-warning scoring systems in hospitals, the speed and accuracy with which chart-users determine patients' early-warning scores has received minimal research attention. DESIGN: Within-subjects, with scoring-system design as the independent variable. METHODS: Forty-seven novice chart-users were presented with realistic vital sign observations recorded on charts with three different scoring-system designs. The rows for recording individual vital sign scores were either: (1) grouped together beneath all of the vital sign rows; (2) separated, with each row presented immediately below the corresponding vital sign row; or (3) excluded altogether. Participants' response times and error rates for determining the overall scores were measured for 54 time-points per design. Data were collected in December 2012-January 2013. RESULTS: Contrary to predictions, participants responded fastest and made the fewest errors when using the chart design without individual vital sign scoring-rows. For the other two designs, participants were faster when the rows for scoring individual vital signs were separated (vs. grouped), but accuracy did not differ. For both of these designs, significantly more time-points were affected by scoring errors compared with adding errors. Finally, data for patients with more serious derangements yielded greater response times and error rates on all three charts. CONCLUSION: Early-warning scoring systems may be more effective without individual vital sign scoring-rows. Even when charts are designed by multi-disciplinary teams of human factors specialists and clinicians, empirical evaluations are essential.\",\n",
        " 'The alternative complement component factor B regulates UV-induced oedema, systemic suppression of contact and delayed hypersensitivity, and mast cell infiltration into the skin.\\nUltraviolet (UV) wavelengths in sunlight are the prime cause of skin cancer in humans with both the UVA and UVB wavebands making a contribution to photocarcinogenesis. UV has many different biological effects on the skin that contribute to carcinogenesis, including suppression of adaptive immunity, sunburn and altering the migration of mast cells into and away from irradiated skin. Many molecular mechanisms have been identified as contributing to skin responses to UV. Recently, using gene set enrichment analysis of microarray data, we identified the alternative complement pathway with a central role for factor B (fB) in UVA-induced immunosuppression. In the current study we used mice genetically deficient in fB (fB-/- mice) to study the functional role of the alternative complement pathway in skin responses to UV. We found that fB is required for not only UVA but also UVB-induced immunosuppression and solar-simulated UV induction of the oedemal component of sunburn. Factor B-/- mice had a larger number of resident skin mast cells than control mice, but unlike the controls did not respond to UV by increasing mast cell infiltration into the skin. This study provides evidence for a function role for fB in skin responses to UV radiation. Factor B regulates UVA and UVB induced immunosuppression, UV induced oedema and mast cell infiltration into the skin. The alternative complement pathway is therefore an important regulator of skin responses to UV.',\n",
        " 'Neural Correlates of Aggression in Medication Naive Children with Adhd: Multivariate Analysis of Morphometry and Tractography.\\nAggression is widely observed in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has been frequently linked to frustration, or the unsatisfied anticipation of reward. Although animal studies and human functional neuroimaging implicate altered reward processing in aggressive behaviors, no prior studies have documented the relationship between fronto-accumbal circuitry-a critical cortical pathway to subcortical limbic regions- and aggression in medication naive children with ADHD. To examine this, we collected behavioral measures and parental reports of aggression and impulsivity as well structural and diffusion MRI from 30 children with ADHD and 31 healthy controls (HC) (mean age, 10+/-2.1 SD). Using morphometry and probabilistic tractography combined with multivariate statistical modeling (partial least squares regression and support vector regression), we identified anomalies within the fronto-accumbal circuit in childhood ADHD, which were associated with increased aggression. Specifically, children with ADHD showed reduced right accumbal volumes and frontal-accumbal white matter connectivity compared with HC. The magnitude of the accumbal volume reductions within the ADHD group was significantly correlated with increased aggression, an effect mediated by the relationship between the accumbal volume and impulsivity. Furthermore, aggression, but not impulsivity, was significantly explained by multivariate measures of fronto-accumbal white matter connectivity and cortical thickness within the orbitofrontal cortex. Our multi-modal imaging, combined with multivariate statistical modeling, suggests that the fronto-accumbal circuit is an important substrate of aggression in children with ADHD. These findings suggest that strategies aimed at probing the fronto-accumbal circuit may be beneficial for the treatment of aggressive behaviors in childhood ADHD.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted article preview online, 03 February 2015. doi:10.1038/npp.2015.18.',\n",
        " 'Dietary restriction protects against experimental cerebral malaria via leptin modulation and T-cell mTORC1 suppression.\\nHost nutrition can affect the outcome of parasitic diseases through metabolic effects on host immunity and/or the parasite. Here we show that modulation of mouse immunometabolism through brief restriction of food intake (dietary restriction, DR) prevents neuropathology in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). While no effects are detected on parasite growth, DR reduces parasite accumulation in peripheral tissues including the brain, and increases clearance in the spleen. Leptin, a host-derived adipokine linking appetite, energy balance and immune function, is required for ECM pathology and its levels are reduced upon DR. Recombinant leptin abrogates DR benefits, while pharmacological or genetic inhibition of leptin signalling protects against ECM. DR reduces mTORC1 activity in T cells, and this effect is abrogated upon leptin administration. Furthermore, mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin prevents ECM pathology. Our results suggest that leptin and mTORC1 provide a novel mechanistic link between nutrition, immunometabolism and ECM pathology, with potential therapeutic implications for cerebral malaria.',\n",

        " \"Transsphenoidal surgery and diabetes mellitus: An analysis of inpatient data and complications.\\nOBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) has emerged as the standard approach for pituitary resection due to its minimally invasive nature. There has been little analysis examining the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on patients undergoing TSS. In this study, we characterize DM's association with postoperative TSS complications. In addition to analysis of associated charges and patient demographics, we performed comparison of complication rates between DM and non-DM patients who have undergone TSS in recent years. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a database encompassing nearly 8 million inpatient hospitalizations, was evaluated for patients undergoing TSS from 2002 to 2010. RESULTS: Of 12,938 TSS patients, 2,173 (16.8%) had a DM diagnosis. The non-DM cohort was younger (50.1 y +/- 16.6SD vs. 56.8 y +/- 14.1; P < 0.001) and had shorter hospitalizations and lesser charges. DM patients had a greater incidence of pulmonary, cardiac, urinary/renal, and fluid/electrolyte complications, and had a lesser incidence of diabetes insipidus (P < 0.05). Upon controlling for age, the greater incidence of pulmonary and fluid/electrolyte complications was present only among patients < 60 years of age. Higher occurrence of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea was noted among black diabetics when compared to non-DM blacks. CONCLUSIONS: DM is associated with greater length of stay and hospital charges among TSS patients. DM patients undergoing TSS have a significantly greater incidence of pulmonary and fluid/electrolyte complications among patients under the age of 60, and greater risk for urinary/renal complications across all ages. Despite a theoretical concern due to an impaired wound-healing in DM patients, association with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea was only noted among black diabetics. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2C.

METHOD: Study was conducted to determine the Surveillance of malaria in South Punjab by microscopy and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULT: samples out of 100 patients were found positive for malarial parasites. One patient was found with mixed infection, whereas P. falciparum and P. vivax infections were detected in 17 and 22 patients, respectively. In nested PCR, genus-specific primers for Plasmodium species. in round 1 and species-specific primers for P. falciparum and P. vivax in round 2 were used. By the application of PCR 41% were found to be infected by Plasmodium spp. Among Plasmodium positive patients: mixed, P. falciparum and P. vivax infection were detected in 10, 15 and 16 patients, respectively. Thirty nine microscopically positive patients confirmed to have Plasmodium spp. One negative by PCR, 2 microscopically negative patients had shown Plasmodium spp. infection (P. falciparum and P. vivax) by PCR. In total samples, P. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infection accounted for 36.6%, 39.0% and 24.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Microscopy was found deficient for interpretation of mixed infections, low parasitaemia, and species specific diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity and efficacy of nested PCR was calculated 95%, 98% and 97%, respectively, showing PCR as a more effective and efficient diagnostic tool for malaria.',\n",
        " 'Identification and Validation of a Linear Protective Neutralizing Epitope in the beta-Pore Domain of Alpha Toxin.\\nThe plethora of virulence factors associated with Staphylococcus aureus make this bacterium an attractive candidate for a molecularly-designed epitope-focused vaccine. This approach, which necessitates the identification of neutralizing epitopes for incorporation into a vaccine construct, is being evaluated for pathogens where conventional approaches have failed to elicit protective humoral responses, like HIV-1 and malaria, but may also hold promise for pathogens like S. aureus, where the elicitation of humoral immunity against multiple virulence factors may be required for development of an effective vaccine. Among the virulence factors employed by S. aureus, animal model and epidemiological data suggest that alpha toxin, a multimeric beta-pore forming toxin like protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis, is particularly critical, yet no candidate neutralizing epitopes have been delineated in alpha toxin to date. We have previously shown that a linear determinant in the 2beta2-2beta3 loop of the pore forming domain of B. anthracis protective antigen is a linear neutralizing epitope. Antibody against this site is highly potent for neutralizing anthrax lethal toxin in vitro and for protection of rabbits in vivo from virulent B. anthracis. We hypothesized that sequences in the beta-pore of S. aureus alpha toxin that share structural and functional homology to beta-pore sequences in protective antigen would contain a similarly critical neutralizing epitope. Using an in vivo mapping strategy employing peptide immunogens, an optimized in vitro toxin neutralization assay, and an in vivo dermonecrosis model, we have now confirmed the presence of this epitope in alpha toxin, termed the pore neutralizing determinant. Antibody specific for this determinant neutralizes alpha toxin in vitro, and is highly effective for mitigating dermonecrosis and bacterial growth in a mouse model of S. aureus USA300 skin infection. The delineation of this linear neutralizing determinant in alpha toxin could facilitate the development of an epitope-focused vaccine against S. aureus.',\n",
        " 'Dopamine Increases CD14+CD16+ Monocyte Migration and Adhesion in the Context of Substance Abuse and HIV Neuropathogenesis.\\nDrug abuse is a major comorbidity of HIV infection and cognitive disorders are often more severe in the drug abusing HIV infected population. CD14+CD16+ monocytes, a mature subpopulation of peripheral blood monocytes, are key mediators of HIV neuropathogenesis. Infected CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration across the blood brain barrier mediates HIV entry into the brain and establishes a viral reservoir within the CNS. Despite successful antiretroviral therapy, continued influx of CD14+CD16+ monocytes, both infected and uninfected, contributes to chronic neuroinflammation and the development of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Drug abuse increases extracellular dopamine in the CNS. Once in the brain, CD14+CD16+ monocytes can be exposed to extracellular dopamine due to drug abuse. The direct effects of dopamine on CD14+CD16+ monocytes and their contribution to HIV neuropathogenesis are not known. In this study, we showed that CD14+CD16+ monocytes express mRNA for all five dopamine receptors by qRT-PCR and D1R, D5R and D4R surface protein by flow cytometry. Dopamine and the D1-like dopamine receptor agonist, SKF38393, increased CD14+CD16+ monocyte migration that was characterized as chemokinesis. To determine whether dopamine affected cell motility and adhesion, live cell imaging was used to monitor the accumulation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes on the surface of a tissue culture dish. Dopamine increased the number and the rate at which CD14+CD16+ monocytes in suspension settled to the dish surface. In a spreading assay, dopamine increased the area of CD14+CD16+ monocytes during the early stages of cell adhesion. In addition, adhesion assays showed that the overall total number of adherent CD14+CD16+ monocytes increased in the presence of dopamine. These data suggest that elevated extracellular dopamine in the CNS of HIV infected drug abusers contributes to HIV neuropathogenesis by increasing the accumulation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes in dopamine rich brain regions.',\n",

Prevalence of infections were determined in Latin American and sub-Saharan African asymptomatic immigrants seen at a European Tropical Medicine Referral Center from 2000 to 2009. A systematic screening protocol for selected infections was used. Data from 317 sub-Saharan Africans and 383 Latin Americans were analyzed. Patients were mostly young (mean age 29 years); there were significantly more males among sub-Saharan Africans (83% versus 31.6%) and pre-consultation period was longer for Latin Americans (5 versus 42 months). Diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection, and latent tuberculosis were significantly more frequent in sub-Saharan Africans (2.3% versus 0.3%; 14% versus 1.6%; 1.3 versus 0%; 71% versus 32.1%). There were no significant differences in prevalence for syphilis and intestinal parasites. Malaria and schistosomiasis prevalence in sub-Saharan Africans was 4.6% and 5.9%, respectively, and prevalence of Chagas disease in Latin Americans was 48.5%. Identifying and treating asymptomatic imported infectious diseases may have an impact both for the individual concerned and for public health.

As platelet activating factor (PAF) is associated with an increase in vascular permeability in other diseases, we set out to investigate its role in acute dengue infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PAF levels were initially assessed in 25 patients with acute dengue infection to determine if they were increased in acute dengue. For investigation of the kinetics of PAF, serial PAF values were assessed in 36 patients. The effect of dengue serum on tight junction protein ZO-1 was determined by using human endothelial cell lines (HUVECs). The effect of dengue serum on and trans-endothelial resistance (TEER) was also measured on HUVECs. RESULTS: PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with acute dengue (n = 25; p = 0.001) when compared to healthy individuals (n = 12). In further investigation of the kinetics of PAF in serial blood samples of patients (n = 36), PAF levels rose just before the onset of the critical phase. PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with evidence of vascular leak throughout the course of the illness when compared to those with milder disease. Serum from patients with dengue significantly down-regulated expression of tight junction protein, ZO-1 (p = 0.004), HUVECs. This was significantly inhibited (p = 0.004) by use of a PAF receptor (PAFR) blocker. Serum from dengue patients also significantly reduced TEER and this reduction was also significantly (p = 0.02) inhibited by prior incubation with the PAFR blocker. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the PAF is likely to be playing a significant role in inducing vascular leak in acute dengue infection which offers a potential target for therapeutic intervention.',\n",
        " 'Task-irrelevant emotion facilitates face discrimination learning.\\nWe understand poorly how the ability to discriminate faces from one another is shaped by visual experience. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether face discrimination learning can be facilitated by facial emotions. To answer this question, we used a task-irrelevant perceptual learning paradigm because it closely mimics the learning processes that, in daily life, occur without a conscious intention to learn and without an attentional focus on specific facial features. We measured face discrimination thresholds before and after training. During the training phase (4days), participants performed a contrast discrimination task on face images. They were not informed that we introduced (task-irrelevant) subtle variations in the face images from trial to trial. For the Identity group, the task-irrelevant features were variations along a morphing continuum of facial identity. For the Emotion group, the task-irrelevant features were variations along an emotional expression morphing continuum. The Control group did not undergo contrast discrimination learning and only performed the pre-training and post-training tests, with the same temporal gap between them as the other two groups. Results indicate that face discrimination improved, but only for the Emotion group. Participants in the Emotion group, moreover, showed face discrimination improvements also for stimulus variations along the facial identity dimension, even if these (task-irrelevant) stimulus features had not been presented during training. The present results highlight the importance of emotions for face discrimination learning.',\n",
        " 'Aged insulin granules display reduced microtubule-dependent mobility and are disposed within actin-positive multigranular bodies.\\nInsulin secretion is key for glucose homeostasis. Insulin secretory granules (SGs) exist in different functional pools, with young SGs being more mobile and preferentially secreted. However, the principles governing the mobility of age-distinct SGs remain undefined. Using the time-reporter insulin-SNAP to track age-distinct SGs we now show that their dynamics can be classified into three components: highly dynamic, restricted, and nearly immobile. Young SGs display all three components, whereas old SGs are either restricted or nearly immobile. Both glucose stimulation and F-actin depolymerization recruit a fraction of nearly immobile young, but not old, SGs for highly dynamic, microtubule-dependent transport. Moreover, F-actin marks multigranular bodies/lysosomes containing aged SGs. These data demonstrate that SGs lose their responsiveness to glucose stimulation and competence for microtubule-mediated transport over time while changing their relationship with F-actin.',\n",
        " 'Effects of Intranasal Oxytocin on Thermal Pain in Healthy Men: A Randomized Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.\\nOBJECTIVE: Intranasal oxytocin has been shown to affect human social and emotional processing, but its potential to affect pain remains elusive. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on the perception and processing of noxious experimental heat in 36 healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Thermal thresholds were determined according to the Quantitative Sensory Testing protocol. A functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment including intensity and unpleasantness ratings of tonic heat was used to investigate the effects of oxytocin within the brain. RESULTS: Thirty men (aged 18-50 years) were included in the study. Intranasal oxytocin had no significant effect on thermal thresholds, but significantly (t = -2.06, p = .046) reduced heat intensity ratings during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The effect on intensity ratings was small (-3.46 points on a 100-point visual analog scale [95% confidence interval {CI} = -6.86 to -0.07] and independent of temperature. No effects of oxytocin on stimulus- or temperature-related processing were found at the whole-brain level at a robust statistical threshold. A region of interest analysis indicated that oxytocin caused small but significant decreases in left (-0.045%, 95% CI = -0.087 to -0.003, t = -2.19, p = .037) and right (-0.051%, 95% CI = -0.088 to -0.014], t = -2.82, p = .008) amygdala activity across all temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence for a significant but subtle inhibitory effect of oxytocin on thermal stimulus ratings and concurrent amygdala activity. Neither of the two effects significantly depended of temperature; therefore, the hypothesis of a pain-specific effect of oxytocin could not be confirmed.Trial Registration: EUDRA-CT 2009-015115-40.',\n",
        " 'ICOS maintains the T follicular helper cell phenotype by down-regulating Kruppel-like factor 2.\\nThe co-stimulators ICOS (inducible T cell co-stimulator) and CD28 are both important for T follicular helper (TFH) cells, yet their individual contributions are unclear. Here, we show that each molecule plays an exclusive role at different stages of TFH cell development. While CD28 regulated early expression of the master transcription factor Bcl-6, ICOS co-stimulation was essential to maintain the phenotype by regulating the novel TFH transcription factor Klf2 via Foxo1. Klf2 directly binds to Cxcr5, Ccr7, Psgl-1, and S1pr1, and low levels of Klf2 were essential to maintain this typical TFH homing receptor pattern. Blocking ICOS resulted in relocation of fully developed TFH cells back to the T cell zone and reversion of their phenotype to non-TFH effector cells, which ultimately resulted in breakdown of the germinal center response. Our study describes for the first time the exclusive role of ICOS and its downstream signaling in the maintenance of TFH cells by controlling their anatomical localization in the B cell follicle.',\n",

METHODS: The study was based on data obtained in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2010 to 2011. Education level and household income were used as indicators for SES. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate SES and other demographic variables as related factors for influenza vaccination, the primary outcome. RESULTS: Higher household income was positively associated with higher vaccine uptake in the younger (19-49 years) group [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.23], whereas the low-income and low-education group had increased vaccination coverage than the middle-income and middle-education group in the older (>/= 50 years) group (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69). Current smokers tend to be unvaccinated in all age groups. Among individuals aged >/= 50, older age, mild to moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and having co-morbidities were positively associated with vaccination, while those who self-reported their health status as good were less likely to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between SES and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage differed between the age groups throughout the adult South Korean population.

IDODEN, which is freely available, can now be used for the annotation of dengue-related data and, in addition to its use for modeling, it can be utilized for the construction of other dedicated IT tools such as decision support systems. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The availability of the dengue ontology will enable databases hosting dengue-associated data and decision-support systems for that disease to perform most efficiently and to link their own data to those stored in other independent repositories, in an architecture- and software-independent manner.',\n",
        " 'An optimal control strategy to reduce the spread of malaria resistance.\\nThis paper presents a mathematical model of malaria transmission considering the resistance of malaria parasites to the anti-malarial drugs. The model also incorporates mass treatment and insecticide as control strategies. We consider the sensitive and resistant strains of malaria parasites in human and mosquito populations. First, we investigated the existence and stability of equilibria of the model without control based on two basic reproduction ratios corresponding to the strains. Then, the Pontryagins Maximum Principle is applied to derive the necessary conditions for optimal control. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the optimal control to reduce the number of infected hosts and vectors.',\n",

Among 1,913,477 Medicare beneficiaries, 367,602 (19.2%) had T2DM. T2DM prevalence increased with age and was higher in blacks (26.4%) and Hispanics (25.5%) than in whites (18.0%); and in Medicare/Medicaid dual-eligible versus non-dual-eligible patients (28.0% vs 17.2%, respectively). Compared with whites, diagnosed hypertension and diabetic retinopathy were more common in blacks and Hispanics, and lipid metabolism disorders and atrial fibrillation were less common. Hypoglycemia requiring health care services was more common in blacks (4.7%) and Hispanics (3.6%) compared with whites (2.9%). T2DM, related comorbidities, and hypoglycemia are burdensome to the Medicare population. Differences in these endpoints were observed based on race/ethnicity, age, and dual-eligible status, highlighting the importance of demographic factors when determining T2DM management strategies.

        " 'Serum CA 19-9 as a good prognostic biomarker in patients with bladder cancer.\\nBACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BC) is the second leading malignant tumors of the genitourinary system. CA 19-9 has served as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for pancreatic carcinoma for years. In recent year, although a few studies have evaluated the roles of CA 19-9 in BC, the results are conflicting and the number of the patients studied is very small. AIM: To investigate the potential of serum CA 19-9 to serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of BC in a larger number of patients. METHODS: A total of 272 (144 BC patients and 128 healthy subjects) were enrolled. Patients were followed-up routinely at 3-month intervals for 5 years. Serum CA 19-9 level was detected by ELISA. RESULTS: CA 19-9 level was much higher than that in healthy subjects (43.69 +/- 6.92 U/ml vs. 12.31 +/- 4.39 U/ml, p < 0.001). However, when the value of 37 U/ml of serum CA 19-9 was used as the cut-off value for BC the sensitivity of CA 19-9 for BC was dropped to 38.8%. CA 19-9 was much higher in muscle invasive tumor subgroup than that in superficial tumor subgroup (38.09 +/- 7.14 U/ml vs. 20.71 +/- 4.15 U/ml, p < 0.027). CA 19-9 level was comparable in both subgroups (29.78 +/- 5.07 U/ml vs. 26.13 +/- 5.97 U/ml, p = 0.565). BC patients with more than 5 years survival time had lower serum CA 19-9 level than the rest (15.86 U/ml vs 46.68 U/ml, p < 0.001). Survival rate (>5 years) of patients with lower CA 19-9 levels (<29 U/ml) was significantly increased in comparison to those with elevated serum CA 19-9 levels (>29 U/ml) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: serum CA 19-9 is not as good diagnostic maker, but a very powerful prognostic marker for BC. Such a study might be helpful for urologists to manage patients with BC.',\n",

        " \"Childhood remembered: Reports of both unique and repeated events.\\nTo explore the significance of repeated memories for individuals' personal histories, we compared the characteristics of young adults' unique and repeated memories of childhood experiences. Memory type (unique vs. repeated) was a within-participant variable. In Experiment 1, college-age participants generated as many early memories as possible in 4 minutes; in Experiment 2, another sample provided complete reports of five early memories in each condition. In both experiments, participants rated the vividness, biographical importance and personal meaning of each memory and labelled the accompanying emotion. Unique memories were more vivid than repeated memories as well as more likely to include negative emotion, regardless of the method of reporting. Most importantly, college students rated their memories for unique and repeated events as equivalently infused with personal meaning. Analysis of the content of the memories reported in Experiment 2 established that unique and repeated memories did not differ in word count or percentages of perceptual terms or words indicating positive affect, although unique memories contained a greater percentage of negative affect. Additional analyses of content provided evidence for differences in the functions served by unique and repeated memories. The results have implications for the study of autobiographical memory and for identifying over-general memories.\",\n",
        " 'Executive control- and reward-related neural processes associated with the opportunity to engage in voluntary dishonest moral decision making.\\nResearch has begun to examine the neurocognitive processes underlying voluntary moral decision making, which involves engaging in honest or dishonest behavior in a setting in which the individual is free to make his or her own moral decisions. Employing event-related potentials, we measured executive control-related and reward-related neural processes during an incentivized coin-guessing task in which participants had the opportunity to voluntarily engage in dishonest behavior, by overreporting their wins to maximize earnings. We report four primary findings: First, the opportunity to deceive recruited executive control processes involving conflict monitoring and conflict resolution, as evidenced by a higher N2 and a smaller P3. Second, processing the outcome of the coin flips engaged reward-related processes, as evidenced by a larger medial feedback negativity (MFN) for incorrect (loss) than for correct (win) guesses, reflecting a reward prediction error signal. Third, elevated executive control-related neural activity reflecting conflict resolution (i.e., an attenuated executive control P3) predicted a greater likelihood of engaging in overall deceptive behavior. Finally, whereas elevated reward-related neural activity (the reward P3) was associated with a greater likelihood of engaging in overall deceptive behavior, an elevated reward prediction error signal (MFN difference score) predicted increased trial-by-trial moral behavioral adjustment (i.e., a greater likelihood to overreport wins following a previous honest loss than following a previous honest win trial). Collectively, these findings suggest that both executive control- and reward-related neural processes are implicated in moral decision making.',\n",
        " 'Role of red blood cell distribution in predicting drug-eluting stent restenosis in patients with stable angina pectoris after coronary stenting.\\nBACKGROUND: It has been reported that increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW) predicts adverse events in cardiovascular disease and in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the role of serum RDW levels in drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum RDW levels and in-stent restenosis (ISR) after coronary stenting with DES in stable angina pectoris (SAP) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 293 consecutive chronic SAP patients with coronary DES implantation were enrolled in this study. The ISR was analyzed by coronary angiography analysis at a mean follow-up of 8 months. According to whether ISR was detected, patients were divided into two groups: the ISR group (n=45) and the non-ISR group (n=247). Serum RDW was assessed both at admission and at the 8-month follow-up in all patients. Standard medication was continued throughout the investigation period. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Patients in the ISR group had significantly higher RDW levels compared with patients in the non-ISR group both at admission and at follow-up (P<0.01, respectively). Furthermore, the ISR group had significantly longer stent length and lower stent diameter compared with the non-ISR group (P<0.01, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, RDW levels, C-reactive protein levels, stent length, and stent diameter were associated independently with ISR. CONCLUSION: Serum RDW level may independently predict ISR at both admission and follow-up in SAP patients with coronary DES implantation, which indicates that a chronic inflammatory response might be involved in the pathogenesis of ISR.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the impact of the PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP on liver enzymes, metabolic indexes, and maternal and neonatal outcomes in 200 GD patients enrolled in a lifestyle intervention. DESIGN: In a randomized trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design, exercise significantly improved maternal and neonatal outcomes in GD patients. Effects of the G allele on metabolic and liver indexes and maternal and neonatal outcomes were evaluated in these patients. RESULTS: At the end of the trial, fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were significantly lower and liver enzymes significantly higher in PNPLA3 G-allele carriers. In a multiple regression model, the G allele was associated directly with aspartate aminotransferase (beta = 2.60; 95% CI: 0.99, 4.20), alanine aminotransferase (beta = 3.70; 95% CI: 1.78, 5.62), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (beta = 3.70; 95% CI: 0.80, 6.60) and inversely with insulin (beta = -2.01; 95% CI: -3.24, -0.78) and HOMA-IR (beta = -0.39; -0.64, -0.14) values at the end of the trial. In a multiple logistic regression model, the G allele was associated directly with risk of developing liver enzyme elevation during pregnancy (OR: 4.21; 95% CI: 1.78, 9.97) and inversely with the birth of large-for-gestational-age newborns (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.62). No diet x genotype or exercise x genotype interaction was shown. CONCLUSION: The PNPLA3 SNP rs738409 G allele was associated with risk of mildly elevated transaminases in GD independent of a lifestyle intervention and despite a significant reduction in insulin resistance and risk of macrosomic offspring. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01506310.',\n",
        " \"Network-based metaanalysis identifies HNF4A and PTBP1 as longitudinally dynamic biomarkers for Parkinson's disease.\\nEnvironmental and genetic factors are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease among the elderly. Network-based metaanalysis of four independent microarray studies identified the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), a transcription factor associated with gluconeogenesis and diabetes, as a central regulatory hub gene up-regulated in blood of PD patients. In parallel, the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), involved in the stabilization and mRNA translation of insulin, was identified as the most down-regulated gene. Quantitative PCR assays revealed that HNF4A and PTBP1 mRNAs were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in blood of 51 PD patients and 45 controls nested in the Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease. These results were confirmed in blood of 50 PD patients compared with 46 healthy controls nested in the Harvard Biomarker Study. Relative abundance of HNF4A mRNA correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage at baseline, suggesting its clinical utility to monitor disease severity. Using both markers, PD patients were classified with 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Longitudinal performance analysis demonstrated that relative abundance of HNF4A and PTBP1 mRNAs significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in PD patients during the 3-y follow-up period. The inverse regulation of HNF4A and PTBP1 provides a molecular rationale for the altered insulin signaling observed in PD patients. The longitudinally dynamic biomarkers identified in this study may be useful for monitoring disease-modifying therapies for PD.\",\n",
        " \"Comparison of the affective symptomatology between liver transplant recipients and patients with multiple sclerosis considering their functional impairment.\\nOBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the affective symptomatology in two medical conditions under immunotherapy (cadaveric liver transplantation [G1] and multiple sclerosis [G2]), considering their functional impairment, and to assess the clinical significance of the results regarding a representative age-adjusted sample of the general Spanish population (G3). METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 164 patients (82 per clinical group) were selected, matched for gender, and homogenized regarding age and functional impairment according to the Physical functioning subscale from the SF-36 Health Survey. The criterion variables were the Mental health and Role-emotional SF-36 subscales and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. An analysis of covariance was conducted, controlling for age and the Physical functioning score as covariates. Cohen's d was reported as an effect size index and to analyze the clinical significance regarding a representative age-adjusted sample of the general Spanish population (n = 7881). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between conditions in any affective dimension (P > .05; ds1-2 from 0.08 to 0.30) or in the percentage of clinical cases regarding the anxious (P = .628) or depressive spectrum (P = .716). The neurological patients showed clinically significant impairment in both SF-36 subscales (ds2-3 = 0.55 and 0.52, respectively), but transplant recipients only differed from the general population in Role-emotional (d1-3 = 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having controlled for functional impairment, important deterioration in daily functioning was still found in liver recipients due to emotional problems, and no relevant differences were observed even when compared with a neurodegenerative condition such as multiple sclerosis.\",\n",
        " 'Avian haemosporidians from Neotropical highlands: Evidence from morphological and molecular data.\\nAvian haemosporidian parasites have been scarcely studied in the Neotropical highlands despite the high avian diversity reported and the uniqueness of these ecosystems. The aims of this study were to examine Haemoproteus and Plasmodium diversity based on morphological and molecular data, as well as to explore the concordance between these two approaches, when identifying species. We sampled 1487 birds belonging to 166 species, in localities of the Colombian Andean region at elevations ranging from 2100 to 4000m above sea level. Here, we report twelve morphological parasite species, of which five are undescribed. Thirty parasite cytochrome b lineages are reported, 17 of which for the first time. We provide morphological information and illustrations, as well as, cytochrome b lineages for six morphospecies: Haemoproteus columbae, Haemoproteus witti, Haemoproteus coatneyi, Haemoproteus vireonis, Plasmodium lutzi, and Plasmodium unalis. This is the first report to provide a linkage between morphology and a molecular lineage for H. witti. Cytochrome b gene proved to be useful for species determination as DNA barcoding. Differences in parasite composition between lowlands and highlands in Colombia suggest a replacement of avian Plasmodium fauna. Parasite lineages restricted to either Colombian resident or Nearctic migratory birds were found; but a single lineage common in both has not been recorded in Nearctic non-migratory birds. We generated valuable information by using both morphological and molecular data representing competent host-parasite relationships which are based on observation of gametocytes in circulation; and increased the taxon sampling of avian haemosporidian.',\n",
        " 'A biomimetic microfluidic chip to study the circulation and mechanical retention of red blood cells in the spleen.\\nRed blood cells (RBCs) are deformable and flow through vessels narrower than their own size. Their deformability is most stringently challenged when they cross micrometer-wide slits in the spleen. In several inherited or acquired RBC disorders, blockade of small vessels by stiff RBCs can trigger organ damage, but a functional spleen is expected to clear these abnormal RBCs from the circulation before they induce such complications. We analyzed flow behavior of RBCs in a microfluidic chip that replicates the mechanical constraints imposed on RBCs as they cross the human spleen. Polymer microchannels obtained by soft lithography with a hydraulic diameter of 25 mum drove flow into mechanical filtering units where RBCs flew either slowly through 5- to 2-mum-wide slits or rapidly along 10-mum-wide channels, these parallel paths mimicking the splenic microcirculation. Stiff heated RBCs accumulated in narrow slits seven times more frequently than normal RBCs infused simultaneously. Stage-dependent retention of Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs was also observed in these slits. We also analyzed RBCs from patients with hereditary spherocytosis and observed retention for those having the most altered mechanical properties as determined by ektacytometry. Thus, in keeping with previous observations in vivo and ex vivo, the chip successfully discriminated poorly deformable RBCs based on their distinct mechanical properties and on the intensity of the cell alteration. Applications to the exploration of the pathogenesis of malaria, hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease and other RBC disorders are envisioned.Am. J. Hematol., 2015.

        " \"Chocolate consumption and risk of diabetes mellitus in the Physicians' Health Study.\\nBACKGROUND: Previous studies reported beneficial effects of cocoa or chocolate on insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which are important risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). However, it is unclear whether chocolate consumption is associated with risk of DM. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that chocolate consumption is inversely associated with incident DM in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS). DESIGN: We prospectively analyzed data on 18,235 PHS participants who were free of DM at baseline (1997-2001). Chocolate consumption was obtained from a baseline food-frequency questionnaire. Incident DM was ascertained via annual follow-up questionnaires and validated in a subsample by a review of medical records. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs and 95% CIs of DM. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age at baseline was 66.3 +/- 9.2 y. During a mean follow up of 9.2 y, 1123 men (6.2%) developed DM. For self-reported chocolate consumption of none, 1-3 servings/mo, 1 serving/wk, and >/=2 servings/wk, multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of DM adjusted for lifestyle, clinical, and dietary risk factors including total energy intake were 1.00 (referent), 0.93 (0.79, 1.09), 0.86 (0.72, 1.04), and 0.83 (0.69, 0.99), respectively (P-trend = 0.047). In secondary analyses, the inverse association of chocolate consumption and risk of DM was slightly stronger in subjects without a history of cardiovascular disease or heart failure (P-trend = 0.023). In addition, both age and BMI modified the chocolate-DM relation (P < 0.05 each). CONCLUSION: Our data support an inverse relation of chocolate intake with incident DM, which appears only to apply in younger and normal-body weight men after controlling for comprehensive life styles including total energy consumption.\",\n",
        " 'Pain Self-Management in HIV-Infected Individuals with Chronic Pain: A Qualitative Study.\\nOBJECTIVE: Chronic pain in individuals with HIV is a common, impairing condition. Behavioral interventions for chronic pain specifically tailored to this population have yet to be developed. We assert that understanding self-management strategies already used by persons living with these conditions is an essential first step, and is the objective of this investigation. DESIGN: We conducted a thematic analysis of qualitative data from 25 in-depth interviews with individuals with HIV and chronic pain. RESULTS: The primary pain self-management strategies articulated by participants were: physical activity; cognitive and spiritual strategies; spending time with family and friends and social support; avoidance of physical/social activity; medication-centric pain management; and substance use. CONCLUSIONS: Some of these strategies may be viewed as beneficial and overlap with known HIV self-management strategies (cognitive strategies), whereas others may have negative health consequences (substance use). Interventions that incorporate healthy self-management strategies may be particularly effective in improving both HIV and pain outcomes.',\n",
        " 'The Anopheles gambiae cE5 salivary protein: A sensitive biomarker to evaluate the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria vector control.\\nEvaluation of vector control is crucial for improving malaria containment and, according to World Health Organization, new complementary indicators would be very valuable. In this study the IgG response to the Anopheles-specific cE5 salivary protein was tested as a tool to evaluate the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in reducing human exposure to malaria vectors. Sera collected during a longitudinal study carried out in Angola, and including entomological and parasitological data, were used to assess the IgG response to the Anopheles gambiae cE5 in both children and adults, before and after the application of insecticide-treated nets. Seasonal fluctuation of specific IgG antibody levels according to exposure was only found in children (up to approximately 14 years old) whose anti-cE5 IgG response dropped after bed nets installation. These results were fully consistent with previous findings obtained with the same set of sera and indicating a substantial reduction of human-vector contact shortly after nets implementation. Overall, children IgG response to the cE5 protein appeared a very sensitive biomarker, which allowed for the detection of even weak exposure to Anopheles bites, indicating it may represent a reliable additional tool to evaluate the efficacy of vector control interventions.',\n",
        " 'Comprehensive Metabolomics Identifies the Alarmin Uric Acid as a Critical Signal for the Induction of Peanut Allergy.\\nBACKGROUND: Food allergy, in particular peanut allergy, is a growing concern in Western countries. The prevalence of allergy to peanut, which currently stands at 1.4%, has nearly tripled between 1997 to 2008. Allergic sensitization is a particularly difficult process to study as it is clinically silent. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify key pathways and mediators critically involved in the induction of allergic sensitization to peanut. METHODS: Comprehensive metabolomics analysis with liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry was used to detect metabolite changes in mice (C57BL/6) undergoing sensitization. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies were performed in mice subjected to two models of peanut sensitization and anaphylaxis that involved either oral or epicutaneous sensitization. Flow cytometric analyses on dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo were used to investigate mechanisms of immune activation. RESULTS: Elevated levels of uric acid (UA) were detected in mice undergoing sensitization as well as in peanut allergic children who were not challenged with peanut. In mice, depletion of UA during sensitization prevented the development of peanut-specific immunoglobulins IgE and IgG1 as well as anaphylaxis while exogenous delivery of UA crystals (MSU) restored the allergic phenotype. MSU enhanced CD86 and OX40L expression on DCs, independently of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and IL-1beta, via a PI3K signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Overproduction of the UA alarmin in the local microenvironment plays a critical role in the induction of peanut allergic sensitization, likely due to its ability to activate DCs. These finding suggest that cellular damage or tissue injury may be an essential requisite for the development of allergic sensitization to foods. This article is protected by copyright.

        " 'Prevalence and risk factors of complicated grief among Sichuan earthquake survivors.\\nBACKGROUND: Disasters usually involves massive casualties, yet few post-disaster studies explore the prevalence of complicated grief (CG) among survivors. Complicated grief is a distinct psychological disorder, and is associated with impaired physical and psychological functions. Given such gap in the literature and the significance of this topic, this study is hoped to offer more information of complicated grief among survivors who lost their loved ones in disaster. Adopting a large scale survey, the prevalence and risk factors of CG among bereaved survivors one year after the Sichuan earthquake in China were explored. METHODS: In total 803 bereaved survivors participated the study by filling a questionnaire on measuring CG symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, intrapersonal factors, earthquake related factors, bereavement related factors, and an interpersonal factor. RESULTS: There were 71.1% of the participants scored higher than the cutoff point of CG symptoms. Close relationship with the deceased, PTSD symptoms, losing means of livelihood, physical injury, and terrifying experience in the earthquake, were identified to be risk factors for CG. LIMITATIONS: The study was cross-sectional and the data was collected through a self-reported questionnaire. The sample was recruited from one of the most severely affected counties, thus the generalizability of the results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: A large portion of bereaved earthquake survivors suffered from CG symptoms one year after the disaster. Risk factors found in this study can be used to identify high risk groups, who need special care, support, and bereavement interventions.',\n",
        " 'Predictors of Barefoot Plantar Pressure during Walking in Patients with Diabetes, Peripheral Neuropathy and a History of Ulceration.\\nOBJECTIVE: Elevated dynamic plantar foot pressures significantly increase the risk of foot ulceration in diabetes mellitus. The aim was to determine which factors predict plantar pressures in a population of diabetic patients who are at high-risk of foot ulceration. METHODS: Patients with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and a history of ulceration were eligible for inclusion in this cross sectional study. Demographic data, foot structure and function, and disease-related factors were recorded and used as potential predictor variables in the analyses. Barefoot peak pressures during walking were calculated for the heel, midfoot, forefoot, lesser toes, and hallux regions. Potential predictors were investigated using multivariate linear regression analyses. 167 participants with mean age of 63 years contributed 329 feet to the analyses. RESULTS: The regression models were able to predict between 6% (heel) and 41% (midfoot) of the variation in peak plantar pressures. The largest contributing factor in the heel model was glycosylated haemoglobin concentration, in the midfoot Charcot deformity, in the forefoot prominent metatarsal heads, in the lesser toes hammer toe deformity and in the hallux previous ulceration. Variables with local effects (e.g. foot deformity) were stronger predictors of plantar pressure than global features (e.g. body mass, age, gender, or diabetes duration). CONCLUSION: The presence of local deformity was the largest contributing factor to barefoot dynamic plantar pressure in high-risk diabetic patients and should therefore be adequately managed to reduce plantar pressure and ulcer risk. However, a significant amount of variance is unexplained by the models, which advocates the quantitative measurement of plantar pressures in the clinical risk assessment of the patient.',\n",
        " 'Antigen expression determines adenoviral vaccine potency independent of IFN and STING signaling.\\nRecombinant adenoviral vectors (rAds) are lead vaccine candidates for protection against a variety of pathogens, including Ebola, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, due to their ability to potently induce T cell immunity in humans. However, the ability to induce protective cellular immunity varies among rAds. Here, we assessed the mechanisms that control the potency of CD8 T cell responses in murine models following vaccination with human-, chimpanzee-, and simian-derived rAds encoding SIV-Gag antigen (Ag). After rAd vaccination, we quantified Ag expression and performed expression profiling of innate immune response genes in the draining lymph node. Human-derived rAd5 and chimpanzee-derived chAd3 were the most potent rAds and induced high and persistent Ag expression with low innate gene activation, while less potent rAds induced less Ag expression and robustly induced innate immunity genes that were primarily associated with IFN signaling. Abrogation of type I IFN or stimulator of IFN genes (STING) signaling increased Ag expression and accelerated CD8 T cell response kinetics but did not alter memory responses or protection. These findings reveal that the magnitude of rAd-induced memory CD8 T cell immune responses correlates with Ag expression but is independent of IFN and STING and provide criteria for optimizing protective CD8 T cell immunity with rAd vaccines.',\n",

An important question is whether the elevated IgG4 response is causal or a reflection of immune-regulatory mechanisms of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate if the IgG4 response in IgG4-RD represents a generalised polyclonal amplification by examining the response to common environmental antigens. METHODS: Serum from 24 patients with IgG4-RD (14 treatment-naive, 10 treatment-experienced), 9 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and an elevated serum IgG4 (PSC-high IgG4), and 18 healthy controls were tested against egg white and yolk, milk, banana, cat, peanut, rice and wheat antigens by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: We demonstrated an elevated polyclonal IgG4 response to multiple antigens in patients with IgG4-RD and in PSC-high IgG4, compared with healthy controls. There was a strong correlation between serum IgG4 and antigen-specific responses. Responses to antigens were higher in treatment-naive compared with treatment-experienced patients with IgG4-RD. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation demonstrated polyclonality. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show enhanced levels of polyclonal IgG4 to multiple antigens in IgG4-RD. This supports that elevated IgG4 levels reflect an aberrant immunological regulation of the overall IgG4 response, but does not exclude that causality of disease could be antigen-driven.',\n",

This study provides information about children's learning and goal attainment related to change in their self-management skills during a diabetes camp. Design and methods. One hundred and thirty-one children completed an evaluation for the first year (year 1), and 68 children completed an evaluation for the second year (year 2). All of the children had type 1 diabetes. During both years, parents provided information about goals for their child before camp started. Children's learning about diabetes self-management, as well as their satisfaction with camp, was assessed at the end of the camp session. In the evaluation for year 2, a goal-setting intervention was also developed, and its effectiveness was assessed through both physicians' and children's reports. Results. Children learned new information during camp about recognizing and managing the signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia and about counting carbohydrates and rotating insulin pump sites. Children were better able to recall their self-management goals in year 2. In terms of benefiting from camp, boys reported learning more than girls about diabetes management, whereas girls were more likely than boys to report that greater opportunities to express feelings were of value. Conclusions. Goal-setting was successful in improving children's recall of their self-management goals. Children benefited from the supportive and educational camp atmosphere. Future research should assess the benefits of camp across multiple camp settings and determine whether educational benefits have long-term effects on children's goal-setting and knowledge and whether these benefits lead to psychosocial improvements.\",\n",

This retrospective cohort study used the Premier-Optum Continuum of Care database (2005-2009) to compare adult patients with type 2 diabetes receiving C/E to those not receiving C/E (control). The index date was the first C/E date or, in the control cohort, a randomly assigned date on which some care was delivered. Patients had at least 6 months' pre-index and 12 months' post-index continuous health plan coverage. Health care costs and glycemic levels were evaluated over 12 and 6 months, respectively, with adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics using propensity score matching (PSM). Results. Of 26,790 patients identified, 9.3% received at least one C/E intervention (mean age 53 years, 47% men) and 90.7% received no C/E (mean age 57 years, 54% men). Standard diabetes education was the most common form of C/E (73%). After PSM, C/E patients had some improvements in glycemic levels (among those with laboratory values available), without increased risk for hypoglycemia, and incurred $2,335 per-patient less in diabetes-related health care costs, although their total health care costs increased. Conclusions. Despite the low uptake of C/E services, C/E interventions may be associated with economic and clinical benefits at 12 months. Further analyses are needed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of such initiatives.\",\n",
        " 'Self-focused attention in response to laboratory stressors among women with premenstrual disorders.\\nThe etiology of premenstrual disorders, including premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorders (PMDD), is not well understood. In the current study, the relationship between self-focused attention (SFA) and premenstrual disorders was examined to explore the hypothesis that women with premenstrual disorders tend to respond to symptoms in a maladaptive manner. Based on retrospective report, clinical interview, and 30-day prospective recording of premenstrual symptoms, women (N = 52) were categorized as meeting criteria for premenstrual disorders (PMD; n = 24) or not (controls; n = 28). Key findings indicated that women with premenstrual disorders reported greater use of SFA in response to negative affect elicited by laboratory tasks than controls, despite no significant differences in change in negative affect between the two groups. Women with premenstrual disorders also reported greater trait levels of SFA and maladaptive coping styles compared to controls. Women with premenstrual disorders may tend to respond to menstrual cycle changes using increased levels of SFA. The interaction between psychological and physiological menstrual cycle-related changes may lead to increased distress and impairment. Implications for psychological contributions to premenstrual distress and disorders are discussed.',\n",
        " \"Ceramide in the regulation of eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death.\\nSimilar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may undergo eryptosis, a suicidal death characterized by cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the cell membrane leading to phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface. As eryptotic erythrocytes are rapidly cleared from circulating blood, excessive eryptosis may lead to anemia. Moreover, eryptotic erythrocytes may adhere to the vascular wall and thus impede microcirculation. Stimulators of eryptosis include osmotic shock, oxidative stress and energy depletion. Mechanisms involved in the stimulation eryptosis include ceramide formation which may result from phospholipase A2 dependent formation of platelet activating factor (PAF) with PAF dependent stimulation of sphingomyelinases. Enhanced erythrocytic ceramide formation is observed in fever, sepsis, HUS, uremia, hepatic failure, and Wilson's disease. Enhanced eryptosis is further observed in iron deficiency, phosphate depletion, dehydration, malignancy, malaria, sickle-cell anemia, beta-thalassemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficiency. Moreover, eryptosis is triggered by osmotic shock and a wide variety of xenobiotics, which are again partially effective by enhancing ceramide abundance. Ceramide formation is inhibited by high concentrations of urea. As shown in Wilson's disease, pharmacological interference with ceramide formation may be a therapeutic option in the treatment of eryptosis inducing clinical disorders.\",\n",
        " 'Infant feeding effects on early neurocognitive development in Asian children.\\nBACKGROUND: Breastfeeding has been shown to enhance global measures of intelligence in children. However, few studies have examined associations between breastfeeding and specific cognitive task performance in the first 2 y of life, particularly in an Asian population. OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between early infant feeding and detailed measures of cognitive development in the first 2 y of life in healthy Asian children born at term. DESIGN: In a prospective cohort study, neurocognitive testing was performed in 408 healthy children (aged 6, 18, and 24 mo) from uncomplicated pregnancies (i.e., birth weight >2500 and <4000 g, gestational age >/=37 wk, and 5-min Apgar score >/=9). Tests included memory (deferred imitation, relational binding, habituation) and attention tasks (visual expectation, auditory oddball) as well as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Children were stratified into 3 groups (low, intermediate, and high) on the basis of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. RESULTS: After potential confounding variables were controlled for, significant associations and dose-response relations were observed for 4 of the 15 tests. Higher breastfeeding exposure was associated with better memory at 6 mo, demonstrated by greater preferential looking toward correctly matched items during early portions of a relational memory task (i.e., relational binding task: P-trend = 0.015 and 0.050 for the first two 1000-ms time bins, respectively). No effects of breastfeeding were observed at 18 mo. At 24 mo, breastfed children were more likely to display sequential memory during a deferred imitation memory task (P-trend = 0.048), and toddlers with more exposure to breastfeeding scored higher in receptive language [+0.93 (0.23, 1.63) and +1.08 (0.10, 2.07) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively, compared with the low-breastfeeding group], as well as expressive language [+0.58 (-0.06, 1.23) and +1.22 (0.32, 2.12) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively] assessed via the BSID-III. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest small but significant benefits of breastfeeding for some aspects of memory and language development in the first 2 y of life, with significant improvements in only 4 of 15 indicators. Whether the implicated processes confer developmental advantages is unknown and represents an important area for future research. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.',\n",
        " \"Mechanisms and pathophysiological significance of eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death.\\nEryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling, is stimulated by Ca2+ entry through Ca2+-permeable, PGE2-activated cation channels, by ceramide, caspases, calpain, complement, hyperosmotic shock, energy depletion, oxidative stress, and deranged activity of several kinases (e.g. AMPK, GK, PAK2, CK1alpha, JAK3, PKC, p38-MAPK). Eryptosis is triggered by intoxication, malignancy, hepatic failure, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, hemolytic uremic syndrome, dehydration, phosphate depletion, fever, sepsis, mycoplasma infection, malaria, iron deficiency, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis may precede and protect against hemolysis but by the same token result in anemia and deranged microcirculation.\",\n",
        " \"Nut consumption and risk of mortality in the Physicians' Health Study.\\nBACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that nut consumption is associated with beneficial cardiovascular outcomes. However, limited data are available on the association between nut intake and all-cause mortality. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that nut consumption is inversely associated with the risk of all-cause mortality. DESIGN: In this prospective cohort study in 20,742 male physicians, we assessed nut intake between 1999 and 2002 via a food-frequency questionnaire and ascertained deaths through an endpoint committee. We used Cox regression to estimate multivariable-adjusted HRs for death according to nut consumption. In secondary analyses, we evaluated associations of nut consumption with cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 9.6 y, there were 2732 deaths. The mean (+/-SD) age at baseline was 66.6 +/- 9.3 y. Median nut consumption was 1 serving/wk. Multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) were 1.0 (reference), 0.92 (0.83, 1.01), 0.85 (0.76, 0.96), 0.86 (0.75, 0.98), and 0.74 (0.63, 0.87) for nut consumption of never or <1 serving/mo, 1-3 servings/mo, 1 serving/wk, 2-4 servings/wk, and >/=5 servings/wk, respectively (P-linear trend < 0.0001), after adjustment for age, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, exercise, prevalent diabetes and hypertension, and intakes of energy, saturated fat, fruit and vegetables, and red meat. In a secondary analysis, results were consistent for cardiovascular disease mortality but only suggestive and non-statistically significant for coronary artery disease and cancer mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data are consistent with an inverse association between nut consumption and the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in US male physicians.\",\n",

        " \"Influence of acute cellular rejection and depressive symptomatology on liver transplant recipients' quality of life.\\nBACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of two variables (acute cellular rejection and depressive symptomatology) on liver transplant recipients' quality of life. METHODS: Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, two groups were selected: 44 patients who had acute cellular rejection and 44 patients without this medical complication. After an average of 6 years since the transplant, patients were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the SF-36 Health Survey. Analysis of variance, t test for unpaired samples, and Cohen's d effect size index were applied. RESULTS: The presence of clinical depressive symptomatology negatively affected all dimensions of quality of life (P < .001; large effect sizes); and interactive effects between factors acute cellular rejection and depressive symptomatology were found in the dimensions role-physical (P = .049) and bodily pain (P = .017). Transplant recipients with clinical depressive symptomatology scored lower on both dimensions (role-physical, P = .110, d = 0.52, medium effect size; bodily pain, P = .001, d = 1.25, large effect size) if they had an acute cellular rejection. In contrast, if they did not exceed the clinical threshold for depressive symptomatology, there were no differences in these dimensions (role-physical, P = .239, d = -0.33, small effect size; bodily pain, P = .555, d = 0.16, null effect size) between transplant recipients with and without acute cellular rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical depressive symptomatology is associated with poorer quality of life in liver transplant recipients; and the long-term differences in the dimensions role-physical and bodily pain between liver transplant recipients with and without acute cellular rejection depend on patients' mental health.\",\n",
        " 'Evaluating the toxic and beneficial effects of lichen extracts in normal and diabetic rats.\\nLichens can be used as a novel bioresource for natural antioxidants. However, there is need for further investigations to validate the lichens used in medicinal remedies. In this study, the effects of Cetraria islandica and Pseudevernia furfuracae lichen species in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes were evaluated. Diabetic rats were treated with aqueous lichen extracts (250 and 500 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks starting at 72 h after STZ injection. On the 14th day, animals were anesthetized, and then metabolic and biochemical parameters were evaluated between control and treatment groups. Pancreatic histology and beta-cell mass were examined by hematoxylin and eosin and insulin immunohistochemistry stainings. Our findings revealed that these lichen species could be used safely in this dose range. In addition, C. islandica extracts showed prominent results compared to the doses of P. furfuracae extract for antioxidant capacity. However, the protectivity of C. islandica extract was inadequate against diabetes-induced pancreatic damages via forming oxidative stress. In conclusion, the usage of C. islandica might serve for early intervening in the risk reduction of type 1 diabetes.',\n",
        " \"TCL1 targeting miR-3676 is codeleted with tumor protein p53 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\\nB-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common human leukemia and dysregulation of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1) oncogene is a contributing event in the pathogenesis of the aggressive form of this disease based on transgenic mouse studies. To determine a role of microRNAs on the pathogenesis of the aggressive form of CLL we studied regulation of TCL1 expression in CLL by microRNAs. We identified miR-3676 as a regulator of TCL1 expression. We demonstrated that miR-3676 targets three consecutive 28-bp repeats within 3'UTR of TCL1 and showed that miR-3676 is a powerful inhibitor of TCL1. We further showed that miR-3676 expression is significantly down-regulated in four groups of CLL carrying the 11q deletions, 13q deletions, 17p deletions, or a normal karyotype compared with normal CD19+ cord blood and peripheral blood B cells. In addition, the sequencing of 539 CLL samples revealed five germ-line mutations in six samples (1%) in miR-3676. Two of these mutations were loss-of-function mutations. Because miR-3676 is located at 17p13, only 500-kb centromeric of tumor protein p53 (Tp53), and is codeleted with Tp53, we propose that loss of miR-3676 causes high levels of TCL1 expression contributing to CLL progression.\",\n",
        " 'Crystal Structures of the Carboxyl cGMP Binding Domain of the Plasmodium falciparum cGMP-dependent Protein Kinase Reveal a Novel Capping Triad Crucial for Merozoite Egress.\\nThe Plasmodium falciparum cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is a key regulator across the malaria parasite life cycle. Little is known about PfPKG\\'s activation mechanism. Here we report that the carboxyl cyclic nucleotide binding domain functions as a \"gatekeeper\" for activation by providing the highest cGMP affinity and selectivity. To understand the mechanism, we have solved its crystal structures with and without cGMP at 2.0 and 1.9 A, respectively. These structures revealed a PfPKG-specific capping triad that forms upon cGMP binding, and disrupting the triad reduces kinase activity by 90%. Furthermore, mutating these residues in the parasite prevents blood stage merozoite egress, confirming the essential nature of the triad in the parasite. We propose a mechanism of activation where cGMP binding allosterically triggers the conformational change at the alphaC-helix, which bridges the regulatory and catalytic domains, causing the capping triad to form and stabilize the active conformation.',\n",
        " 'Molecular basis of carcinogenesis in diabetic patients (Review).\\nThe most important molecular mechanisms promoting carcinogenesis in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) include oxidative stress, excessive generation of free radicals and nitrous oxide, damage to cellular membranes and DNA, overproduction of lactate, overabundance of protein glycosylation storage products, overexpression of pathological enzyme isoforms, and leakage of cytochromes from organelles. Additionally, dysfunctional signal transduction pathways, especially in pathways involving phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/Akt, RAS/Raf/ERK, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), have been implicated in malignant transformation and progression. Obesity and metabolic disorders, such as DM, may contribute to a dysfunctional immune system with a suppressed immune response by inducing a chronic inflammatory state, abnormal humoral and cellular mediated immunity, and lower counts and activity levels of natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T cells (NKT cells). Recent advances in molecular biology will allow for better understanding of abnormal cellular pathways, as well as elucidating how metabolic disorders contribute to oncogenesis. Knowledge gained through these studies may lead to more efficacious oncologic therapies.',\n",

The drug has been used successfully to treat malaria patients in clinical studies, thus validating IspC as an antimalarial target. However, improvements of the drug s pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are desirable. Here we show that the conversion of the phosphonate moiety into acyloxymethyl and alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl groups can increase the in vitro activity against asexual blood stages of P. falciparum by more than one order of magnitude. We also synthesized double-prodrugs by additional esterification of the hydroxamate moiety. Prodrugs with modified hydroxamate moieties are subject to bioactivation in vitro. All prodrugs demonstrated improved antiplasmodial in vitro activity. Selected prodrugs and parent compounds were also tested for their cytotoxicity towards HeLa cells and in vivo in a Plasmodium berghei malaria model as well as in the SCID mouse P. falciparum model.',\n",
        " 'Update: malaria, U.S. Armed Forces, 2014.\\nU.S. service members are at risk of acquiring malaria infection when they are present in endemic areas because of long-term duty assignments, participation in shorter-term contingency operations, or personal travel. The number of malaria cases in 2014 (n=44) was slightly higher than in 2012 and 2013, but remained relatively low compared to 2005-2011. In 2014, more than one-third of cases were linked to Africa (n=15); 10 cases to Korea; and eight to Afghanistan. More than half (52%) of the 2014 cases were caused by Plasmodium falciparum (n=23) and 16% by P. vivax (n=7); one-third were reported as \"unspecified\" malaria. Malaria was reported from 30 different medical facilities in the U.S., Afghanistan, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, and the U.K. The relatively low numbers of cases during 2012-2014 likely reflect a decrease in the number of troops who served in Afghanistan in those years. Providers of health care to military members should be knowledgeable regarding, and vigilant for, clinical presentations of malaria outside of endemic areas.',\n",
