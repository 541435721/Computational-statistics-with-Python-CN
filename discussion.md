What would you like your students to learn in a 2nd course on statistical computing?
========================================

Background
----------------------------------------

* Offering STA 633: Statistical computing and computation in Spring 2015
* Schedule is 2 lectures (75 mins) and 1 lab (75 mins) per week
* This is a *2nd* course in statistical computing - pre-req is Colin Rundel's class
    * [STA 523](https://stat.duke.edu/~cr173/Sta523_Fa14/)
    * Quite fast-paced - recommended books are
        * Advanced R - Wickham 
        * R Packages - Wickham
    * Will cover ```Unix shell```, ```make```, ```git```, ```markdown``` and programming in R
    * We will have a pretest to determine eligibility if students have not taken STA 523

Our proposed learning objectives
----------------------------------------

* Basically teach all the computing that we would personally like to see in a PhD student or postdoc working with us
    * Comfortable using both high (Python/Julia?/R) and low level languages (C/C++)
    * Understand data management and use of relational database
    * Can build reproducible data analysis pipelines (make + literate programming)
    * Can convert a statistical model (e.g. from manuscript or textbook) into a numerical algorithm
           * Understanding of basic algorithms for optimization, simulation and smoothing
			   * Building blocks for large classes of statistical algorithms
               * Advice on what algorithms students should know?
		   * Pragmatic usage of libraries for established numerical routines
               * Recommendations for C/C++ libraries
           *
